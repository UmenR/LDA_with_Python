      "With enough creativity, all elements can avoid falling to their death \n",
      "with air you can basically control all the other elements\n",
      "That was my first thought too! I am terrified of heights. If I was an airbender my worst phobia will be gone in the wind... \n",
      "Well if you are falling into earth several earthbenders through the series have sunk themselves in the ground to lessen the fall.\n",
      "As a person that fears height, I love this idea\n",
      "What you are saying is... there is no fall damage?\n",
      "As a skydiver , I like this logic. Don't need a chute if you're able to manipulate the air around you.\n",
      "Well if you are smart enough then falling to your death is avoidable regardless of being an air bender or not\n",
      "Falling to death is avoidable with all of them ..\n",
      "Is that a common occurrence? How many times have you fallen to your death?\n",
      "You could also suffocate someone to death by depriving them of oxygen. So it would come in handy in combat situations too. Aang was too stupid to realize this smh.\n",
      "Fire could probably get you a hand jetpack\n",
      "There is only 2 airbenders ever who could fly. Unless you have that flying thing you’re very much gonna fall to your death as an airbender.\n",
      "You can fly with fire bending.\n",
      "But u could use your other bending powers to some way save yourself from falling to death like Fire Boosting urself or cushioning urself with water\n",
      "Man, and here I chose fire to stay warm. I would love to be able to jump off a skyscraper sized building and just land without hurting. However, according to someone I used to know, at high heights, organs apparently are destroyed just by falling, although it might not be true based off seeing Skydivers fall long distances. Also think at Burj Khalifa heights, nothing could cushion you from the fall, unless you make it slower as you fall\n",
      "to be fair at some point in the series basically every kind of bender finds a way to do that. except maybe earth\n",
      "Technically, it also is if you’re a good enough firebender, or if you’re a water bender with water nearby.\n",
      "I’d still go with air though\n",
      "Why not just use water or earth to slow your fall? You could use both of them then air just becomes a bit shit \n",

      "Let go your earthly tether, enter the void, empty, and become wind.\n",
      "i mean azular basically put rockets on her hands and feet to essentially \"fly\" once or twice. earth benders and water benders have also been shown to fall from heights and have their element reach up and grab them and lower them safely. \n",

      "You can avoid it as both a fire and earth bender as well, and if you have a lot of water around then water too\n",
      "I’d choose water so I couldn’t drown\n",
      "As an earth bender you can't take fall damage as you can use the earth to grab you or use sand to soft the fall (and I know i said fall damage.. I'm too tired to change it) \n",

      "What if I want to fall to my death?\n",
      "Air because gliding looks fun, the air ball aang rides also looks hella fun, and you are absolutely OP in a fight (probably why airbenders were pacifists, you can’t possibly win a fight against a guy who can just create a vacuum around you and suffocate you from 100 yards out)  \n",
      "You could use enough air to lift up rocks and \"earthbend\" same with water. Air bending is definitely the magnum opus\n",
      "Air because with air you can counter or totally control the other elements, fire cannot exist without air (specifically oxygen), you could use strong winds to move water, and uhhhh now that I think about it earth is just earth, well you could fly up if there as an earthquake or something.\n",
      "Would also be fun to ride an air scooter\n",
      "Earth benders could place the ground closer to them.\n",
      "Is...is nearly falling to your death a regular risk for you??\n",
      "If you were an earth bender you could just push the earth away from you slightly slower than your fall speed and slowly catch up to it\n",
      "What if you bend water out of the air and make a minecraft style water drop?\n",
      "Or fire can dampen your speed.\n",
      "Sadly earth doesn't seem like it can save you from itself\n",
      "Haven't you seen Aang use water to catch himself when battling Ozai? I'm sure you could do that with earth as well, and come on, firebenders can propel themselves with their bending. All benders should be able to survive a fall!\n",
      "In other words: no fall damage \n",

So a fire bender can be completely  powerless if the air bender understands physics properly. The same is  said with water, H2O is essentially water with two hydrogen. atoms and  one oxygen atom which means that in theory, air benders can also ***'bend'***  water just as a metal bender can bend metal with impurities. This is no  different. In fact I've always wondered why air benders haven't bended  water since water contains oxygen atoms. Chalk it up to the writer's  ignorance of physics maybe.\n",

      "Speaking as a bartender, fire might also be cool. But mostly water. The question is, how good would you have to be to bend alcohol? Would liquor be too heavy since it’s typically only 60-40% water? Would you bend the water out of it making it 200 proof? Could you bend beer more easily because it has a greater water content? If powerful benders can bend blood I’m sure they could do alcohol, but could a common bender manage it? No matter what, it would probably make for some cool bar tricks.\n",

On the surface, they have a relatively weak looking army that their opponents would go ahead and do a head-on attack. Once the enemies are close enough, but before they make contact with the front line of the Earth army, the hidden Earthbenders bend the ground out from underneath their enemies. Now the opposing army is stuck in a pit. The Earthbenders don’t have to lose a single man. They all get up to the surface and create a ground level roof over their enemies. Now they’re stuck underground and can’t climb out. At this point, the Earthbenders just fill in the space around their enemies, burying/crushing them alive. Nobody would live to tell the tale.

      "I choose air.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it’s a difficult choice because of how specific the powers can get. Leaving aside the mystical aspect of Avatar, the real world applications of these disciplines could be staggering, especially with specialization and control. Canon examples include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Earth equals metalbending equals insanely powerful supercomputers and advanced technology in general. \n",
      "\n",
      "Water equals bloodbending equals cellular biological manipulation and both major and micro surgery. We’re talking self-directed evolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fire equals lightning equals the ability to add and subtract energy from atoms. Atomic fission, assembly and disassembly of matter, creating new elements, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can’t think of a canon specialization for air, but if you think about it, wind in nature is the result of pressure differentials in the air around us caused by differences in temperature or humidity. This implies that water and fire powers could control air indirectly, and perhaps air is not a separate power but an unconscious merger of the two powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "If that isn’t the case, perhaps air is the greatest power of all since it implies that the air power is really the power to add energy to an order of magnitude more atoms than any of the previous powers in order to propel them in a specific direction en masse. While that’s true of fire as well, the floor for the energy added to each atom seems to be the point where the aggregate material bursts into flame or the electrical energy discharges.\n",
      "\n",
      "As such, control of air means you can manipulate atoms with a much more granular touch and finer tuned control as a result. Manipulation at a conscious level on such a small scale would likely be the result of teams of air gifted people coordinating on the scale of say, NASA mission control, but it could be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you look at it that way, the Avatar — who controls all of those powers and has the ability to control them on a much greater scale — is wasted as a warrior. He or she could literally be an immortal god, renewing or recreating their body’s cells when they begin to decay because of injury, age, or disease, and reshaping it to fit their need.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, s/he would need to be immensely knowledgeable in order to do that, and I know I said we’d ignore the mystical aspects here, but I feel obligated to point out that while neither Aang nor Korra were scholars, they did (yes, I know about what happened to Korra but we’ll also avoid addressing that for now) have the collective memory of the Avatar to draw on. It seems near impossible that none of their predecessors were scholars, and even if they also started as warriors, presumably most of them lived long lives of learning as revered leaders of society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of that let’s take this post in a completely different direction, mostly because I’m brainstorming this as I write it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Not only would it benefit society an order of magnitude more for the Avatar to be a scholar, but the most efficient task of the Avatar once s/he accesses his Avatar memory should simply be to regurgitate lost knowledge from the past as well as to buffer current knowledge for future generations simply by living life, as well as steering humanity’s development from the vantage point of collective wisdom and life experience, like Leto II from Dune.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of Dune, I wonder if airbenders could eventually create something like sandworm spice from, turning everyone into Avatar/Muad’Dib/Reverend Mother like beings who are able to control all matter. Sure, powers seem to be handed down along familial lines, but two differently powered people having children had to have happened throughout history. This implies that perhaps the potential to control all the powers is universal but latent, much like how your parents’ combinations of recessive and dominant genes determines your eye color, for instance. Not only that, but it would mean that most people have a power different from theirs in their lineage, and with the ability to access the memories of their direct ancestral line, they would have the knowledge and experience to control it also. \n",
      "\n",
      "And there you have it, lol. A simple “what power would you choose” post leads to a perhaps rambling conclusion that a world like Avatar’s would result in all of mankind becoming immortal, all-powerful gods, masters of all that they survey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, there’s also the distinct possibility that with each person being their own hive mind, and with sharing so many common memories in terms of our common ancestors, and granular control over our own bodies, we would eventually become so much like a faux hive mind that we’d simply figure out how to become one and opt to do it, or that it would happen naturally if we were unable to self direct our evolution. We would become the Borg, except without having to assimilate other species or have our component bodies or collective mental link be dependent on crudely grafted cybernetics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, let’s also not forget that with fine grained control of our environment, both without and within, we would naturally develop space travel. We wouldn’t be dependent on anything external with the ability to create and destroy matter and energy, and freed of those constraints, we’d be free to leave the planet or move it with us on it. Post scarcity on an epic level.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m not on hallucinogens right now, but I think this is an appropriate quote to close with:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Today, a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration – that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively.

In modern society water is even more widespread and easily accessible, and just as portable.  Next up is waters versatility. You can put up a solid defense *and* offense at the **same time**. Earth is the only other element quite like that, and unlike earth you can still see through your defensive barrier while you attack. Speaking of earth; water is the only element, outside of the relatively rare lava bending, that gives access to phase shifts of the same element. Then theres **bloodbending**. Easily the most lethal form of bending as a whole. Why bother making a bubble of vacuum around a person's head with airbending when you could burst the blood vessels in their brain and cause a mass stroke killing them nearly instantly? Then of course there's the far more benevolent side with healing. So yes, water is 100% the objective choice here. \n",

      "If you were to be a bender in today's world, you would start from scratch and if you dedicated your entire life to mastering this (assuming you wouldn't just get hella rich real quick and live on a yacht and stuff, or get kidnapped and dissected by US/Russia/China) you would still probably suck at it by comparison. Toph was like the Gretzky of earthbending. Sure you would know that metalbending is possible, maybe study all the different forms and techniques that are in the show and stuff, and thrust your hands at metal and it just wouldn't budge. \n",
      "\n",
      "Plus your chosen element might not even match your personality so you'd just be super frustrated (like how Aang couldn't initially get the hang of earthbending because he was a trixy airbender) with nobody to teach you. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given all that, I'd probably choose earthbending because I'm stubborn af and moving rocks around and shit would be siiick. Could eventually learn enough to build houses pretty quickly. Maybe even bootleg fly, fling a rock and stand on it :D\n",

      "I'd say earth because it's arguably the most abundant and the most versatile. There are places in the world where water is incredibly scarce (and if we're going by the way it's depicted in the Avatar universe you apparently can't easily collect moisture ouf o the air), and there's only so many ways for air-bending and fire-bending to be useful, but earth is literally everywhere people live!\n",
      "\n",
      "There's also metal-bending and sand-bending, which appears to be learnable extensions of earth-bending, which could be incredibly useful if we're talking industrial application. You could use bending for sandblasting, and metal-bending would make mining so much easier, safer *and* environmentally friendlier! If you're a good enough bender, you'd be able to sense the minerals in the earth, so harmful prospecting becomes a thing of the past, and then you'd just bend the metal straight out of the earth with hopefully minimal effects on the environment!\n",

      "At the maximum possible level, though, Air is unstoppable. You effectively have access to telekinesis, you can create devastating vacuums at will, you can suffocate someone, blow their lungs open, twist their head off, or just throw them really really hard. You have invisible weaponry via air constructs, a nigh-impenetrable shield in the form of a tornado, the means to clear our any otherwise-unbreakable fortress or barrier, the ability to freeze or scorch a target at will, and the ability to effectively earthbend and waterbend (and maybe even firebend) at will. Plus there’s flight, slow falling, stopping projectiles, and so much more. Water and earth can be redirected, fire can be stopped with a vacuum, bloodbending isn’t as fast as a good old fashioned neck snap or 600 mph gust of wind, and even targeting the earth beneath you doesn’t work if you’re flying. In combat, Air is incredibly effective, able to kill quickly, and absurdly versatile. I’d choose Air in a heartbeat. It’s incredibly underrated, imo.\n",

      "And then we reach the theoretical limit of each element’s power. Water could theoretically create global floods and tsunamis and flood the planet, earth could split the planet in half or even throw another planet at ours, and fire could generate what would effectively be massive bombs of heat that would be as destructive as atomic bombs - or worse. But where air’s maximum power lies is dependent on whether all gases fall under air. If not, then hey, a supersonic wind destroying all human infrastructure and probably killing most land and air based life is good enough. If it is, though, then prepare to be smacked in the face with planet motherfucking Jupiter, or maybe even an entire nebula.\n",

      "Man, as a kid I'd always pretend to be a firebender, doing flying jump kicks and punches. Zuko was my idol and everything, plus they were so COOL and POWERFUL! My days as a high schooler though, I found doing dumb shit on rolly chairs at the end of class was way more fun. If I was an airbender I'd probably never even walk ever again. I'd spend all my time doing that thing from the intro where he's riding around on his little air balls, or flying. Flying'd be pretty dope too, can't do that with fire. Well, I suppose you could use them like a jetpack? I guess every element had a way to make themselves levitate sorta. Plus I'd have to worry about the air blowing my shirt up or something. Man I don't know, is there even a reason to post this anymore? Probably not, but I'm in too deep now. Always wanted to do one of those indoor skydiving things, especially now that they're advertising the VR stuff, that seems pretty cool. I think you have to train to be able to do that though, and I don't really want to put in the time and effort to do that. Man, would I have to train my airbending skills? Oh boy, I tend to fidget a bunch, adding elements to my fidgeting seems like a bad idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Y'all read that other thread where the guy got his cancer cured because they programmed bacteria or something? Wild stuff man, Programmable bacteria. Makes you wonder about your own brain. Well, it makes me wonder about my own brain. Like, all those electrons firing or however it works? My only knowledge of how the brain works comes from Jimmy neutron, and it seemed like there was a lot of electricity happening in there. Wonder if there'll be a way to program a human like that where they follow the programming that was implanted in them instead of doing things of their own volition. I guess it'd be easier to just make an electrochip like they do in the movies than do all that crazy microbioprogramming. Maybe bending would be able to help with bioprogramming, lord knows I wouldn't be able to do it though. Way too clumsy, that's why I probably shouldn't be a firebender too. Would burn the hell out of myself and everything around me. Would get a visit from wolverine to put me out of my misery like that own x-men comic. I don't normally read comics, but that one got posted to a reddit thread or something. I think it's just intimidating to get started reading comics though. They've been around for nearly a century now, where does one even start? It's not like a typical book series where it's like \"oh hey this is book one\", but then again it's not like a book series at all. It's like a hundred book series all combined into one. I really like the McElroy Brothers and their work though, and they recently got hired to write a few Thor comics I think. Seems like a good a place as any I think. People seem to think I read comics, guess I just have that look to me. Anytime I go to see any marvel movie with my parents, they're always asking me if I know who this is or who that is or what was up with that end credits scene, huh? The problem is is that I spend enough time on the internet that I kinda know some of the answers to the stuff they're asking me, but they think I know everything. I'm just finding out stuff at the same time as you for the most part. Oh man, if I just suddenly got bending powers, would that make me a superhero? I live in the middle of nowhere, I don't think I'd be able to do much good. Could break up a few pasture parties, maybe bust a meth lab. That's not really superhero stuff, and the local kids would probably think I'm a dick, not a hero. Not like I can just fly to Iraq, kill Osama Bin Laden and call it a day. Modern weaponry has probably surpassed element bending anyways. Airbending might be able to do some cool stuff with that in case you're able to make a wicked enough wind wall to block projectiles. Maybe I'll just buy a katana and see if I can get hired by Riot as a performer or something. Seems like a waste of talent though, could do a lot better. Could do some real Cirque du Soleil shit actually. Could do some wicked cool stunts with airbending, put on quite a show. I'd be worried that the rest of the cast would hate me though. I mean, they dedicate so much of their lives perfecting their art and keeping their body in peak condition so that they can do all this impressive acrobatic stuff and then I just come in, this out of shape 21 year old and start just flying like Criss Angel. Like, how can you compete with that? It's like using performance enhancing drugs. In fact, I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't be allowed to do any sort of competing in any fashion. Superhuman feats in a competition intended for humans is generally frowned upon I think. I mean, Michael Phelps is a freak of nature, but he's still human (I think). His body is made for swimming, but it's not like he's waterbending to make himself faster. That'd be a completely different story, take all his medals away. But then again, then you'd just end up with Ryan Lochte being the big name, and after the Brazil Olympics I just thinks he's kind of a jerk. There's Katie Ledecky too now that I think about it. I'd be fine with her becoming the face of American swimming, she's pretty talented. I don't know her personally, but she seems nice enough. I don't know, I'm not sure the Olympics have the same oomph as they used to. Yeah there's not any global conflicts that are spicing it up anymore, *and that's great btw*, but I mean last year we got a girl playing just so that she could go to the Olympics. Barely even competed. I mean, that part where she turned in a circle was cool I suppose. Maybe they need to bring back the oiled up greco-roman wrestling, really return to their roots. Is Greece doing alright by the way? I remember hearing that they were having a lot of financial difficulties, but then I don't remember hearing much after that. Can bending be used to stimulate economies? I mean, I can't think of anything a bender might be able to do that we humans haven't already invented the tools to do. I suppose you wouldn't have to buy as much of that aforementioned expensive equipment though if you had a bender. There'd have to be some kind of safety stuff though, right? Like, you can't just say \"oh yeah we don't need these cranes or anything like that anymore, we have earthbenders! We'll just pay these guys a little over minimum wage and it'll be just as good.\" I mean, Ba Sing Se was a pretty cool city with some nifty ideas, maybe it would be a good idea. They didn't have any sort of electricity though that I can remember, so maybe that'd be a bit different when you start to add wiring or plumbing into the mix. Maybe I should go back and format this, it's become pretty dense and is honestly a bit of a strain on the eyes and mind. I used to try to make YouTube videos. Well, I still do, but I don't post them anymore. It's a lot harder playing a game and commenting on the same time than you'd think. I'd watch other content creators and think \"Oh it's so OBVIOUS, maybe if you READ you'd know what's going on!\" but there's a lot going on in that case. The kind of video I was doing was mostly improv, I'm sure if you had some sort of scripted video it'd be a bit different. I'd be trying my dangdest to be good at a game and be entertaining at the same time, but it's rough to focus on two things at once. Turned into a lot of stream of conscious rambling, which is debatably entertaining. There were a few videos I made that I was proud of, but I'm not sure how many redeeming values they really had. It's still fun to go in and record myself every now and then, but putting the effort into making thumbnails, descriptions, tags, editing if it needed it, it just wasn't as fun. Well, actually it was a lot of fun, I just don't have a lot of time for it anymore, and that's a darn shame. Working full time while going to college is a lot to deal with. Trying to be unique is a lot to deal with. What really makes one person different than the other? What would make a person choose one person over the other? With the billions of people on this earth, yeah I can say \"hey I think I'm kinda funny and nice and have a good personality! I'm enthusiastic and a little excitable, and decent to look at in my own opinion!\" but like, that doesn't really make me unique, huh? That certainly didn't make my videos unique. I get overly ambitious anyways. I made on skit video that I really liked, and as soon as I was done I started writing ideas for the next one. It was not something I had the capability to do though, so it's just waiting in my notes for me to act on it one day. I enjoyed making videos though, and the few people who watched enjoyed them too, and that's what's important at the end of the day. That's really what's important about life, huh? Animals have it easy, their sole purpose is the continuation of their species. Humans don't really have to worry about that all that much nowadays, so I guess the meaning of my life is just spreading joy. That's how I figure it. I used to be really depressed until I reached out for help. Meds helped some, but it was mostly just a lifestyle change that really helped me get back on my feet. There's something powerful about hitting that breaking point in depression, but Hyperbole and a Half did a way better job making a comic about it then I will rambling about it. The main thing for me though, is that I never really want anyone to feel the way I did. We find our own meaning in life, no matter how inconsequential it might be, and I think as long as I'm happy, and I'm helping others be happy, then I'll live a pretty good life. People warn me about others taking advantage of me, but I'd rather help 9 people out and have one take advantage than to be too scared of that too even try\n",

      "Fire, mainly because I was always drawn to that style of bending. It’s also unique in that it’s a manipulation of energy, not matter, like the other elements. With enough practice, not only could you generate electricity (lightning), you could master temperature control. With enough dedication you could even master the most obscure uses for energy manipulation. Being able to control the activity/energy of atoms has tons of insane uses. In combat, if a water bender were to create an ice barrier, you could melt it as quickly as they solidified it, or turn everything they bend into steam, you could create conflicting temperature currents when fighting an air bender, making their targeted attacks ineffective, against an earth bender you could heat anything they’re trying to bend into magma, making it only bendable by a lava bender, or simply stop it in its tracks. You could make yourself impervious to heat or cold damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "By really focusing and training your control of energy, you could both give and take it. Freeze people by removing all of the atomic energy in their bodies, create energy vacuums, or you could incinerate them. By mastering energy manipulation, you determine what your opponent is capable of. Heat, light, magnetism, electrostatic, movement, food that fuels the body, and even gravity are all just different kinds and behaviors of energy just ripe for the bending. Energy is the power/action, matter is just the object/tool.\n",

      "It's infinitely useful a thing to have control over, you could prevent flooding, tsunamis, produce rain for areas that need it, maybe enhance water powered machinery with a steady current, refill a dried out patch of land that once was a river or a lake... I'd have some level of control over fire too as manipulating water should give me the ability to put out fires with ease, saving a whole lot of trouble. Every person could have their source of running water that can be filtered and used accordingly, and as bonus, I could also Moses some bodies of water wherever there's a disaster to keep people from the dangers of drowning, predators who live in water, or if you're completely unlucky, freezing after your ship's sank in water not suitable for cruising. \n",

The gazelle that doesn't need to mind its neck for crocodiles when sipping the shallow pit might over-populate and decimate the vegetative supply for other animals, leading to starvation, mortal competition, and the regression of fundamental predators because their prey migrated or died out. Next, you know someone is going to try and monopolize water distribution for humans, and one nutcase is gonna try to have ice melted, unleashing those dormant devastating multi-cellular organisms that no one could take, like some shit from \"The Thing\".\n",

Water bending also gets blood bending. Granted, not everyone can do this, but it is still very powerful. Finally, water bending has lots of times where it is extra powerful.

      "Water is arguably the most powerful because of it’s ability to bend water, ice and blood. Major disadvantages of this however is the societal pressure to never blood bend and that water has to be readily available around you to bend it. That makes this on par with fire with no real tie breaker because they both have an equal amount of cool to look at flair. \n",

The only way Aang broke free was using the Avatar State and he was forced to use energybending to remove Yakone's bending, as it was deemed far too dangerous. That's right, the only way you'll be able to counter bloodbending is if you are an equally skilled or better bloodbender than your opponent, or if you are the Avatar and enter the Avatar State.

      "\n",
      "Fire has powerful destructive energy and is a catalyst for change, and the power can also control Lightning (if you go by The Last Airbender). However, it's almost useless for construction, unless you have time to use a forge or want to make something out of glass. When mastered, it is the best element for direct offense, but not so impenetrable as a defense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earth may seem at first to be the most useful, as someone else pointed out. It is essentially the control of all solid minerals, and is very useful on earth. One has great constructive capability, especially since you can shape metal, as well. Earthquakes. However, in the show, the basis of earthbending is a stance on the ground, rendering earthbenders relatively weak when separated from it. This means that if someone were to directly impact you with air, water, or fire, they could send you flying and render you prone. No other element has such a weakness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Water flows like the natural motion of a person, so it is likely the most intuitive for combat applications. Ice is useful for impromptu constructs, which can briefly emulate earthbending, but they cannot last except in subzero climates. Water can also be drawn from the air (except in very arid areas), and is found in plants and animals, allowing for puppet-like control of life and influence of weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "Air is the most underrated of the elements, because it seems ephemeral and flimsy, but it can be extremely useful when mastered. Acute vibration of the air can be used to create shockwaves and to synthesize and replicate sounds, potentially even modifying or silencing voices. Peoples' abilities to breathe can be restricted, dust can be swept into a smokescreen, and high-speed flight is easily attainable. Weather and atmospheric conditions like tornadoes and hurricanes can be trigerred, and one could breathe almost anywhere.\n",

      "2. A subset of healing which we're all thinking is bloodbending. Sure it's a very rare ability, at least when there's no full moon but for all we know, it's something you can learn if you try really hard, and even if you don't use it offensively, you can use it for defense (become a rough and tough crime fighter). Also (I don't know very much about anatomy) what if you could bend the chemicals inside your own body and make yourself a super human? \n",
      "3. You could use it for all types of water sports, swimming, surfing, etc. and do it amazingly, maybe even become a part of the olympic team? And think of the winter sports! If you're good at art, you can do incredible ice sculptures or the best snowmen! AND SNOWBALL FIGHTS!\n",
      "4. This one depends on how bending works, and works with earth as well, so if bending the element depends on where the elements are in relation to you it won't work, but you could possibly fly! If you froze a patch of ice and stood on it, or bent it around your feet/body you could raise that into the air and FLY!\n",
      "4.1. You could move stuff around by using the above technique (freeze water under it and move it around)\n",
      "5. Water is everywhere! It's in the air, it's in stuff, it's in you! Katara and the innkeeper showed us a million ways to draw water, from sweat to pulling it out of plants, etc.\n",
      "6. You could clean water! You might have to concentrate very hard, but you could theoretically separate water from anything. This might not work, again it depends on how bending works, and you might need pinpoint precision but you might be able to separate the water from the stuff in it (you might be able to \"sense\" the water at the smallest level idk)\n",

Or you can give more energy to other things, for example: give more energy to the hydrogen and oxygen in air and you have an explosion (and also water). Give energy to the rocks and you have an earthquake, take it away and you stop one. And so on. Obviously you can also lit things up but that is a side effect less useful\n",

      "- Fire is useless. Sure, there's the ability to burn things or do lightning, but lightning? Yeah.... You can literally kill yourself by a single misstep with the latter and the former has the benefit of what my stove, oven and microwave can do for me. Also, there's the entire deal with spontaneous combustion so chi could be overclocked so high that it causes the body to set on fire. So unless I'm in some apocalypse or a place that lacks heat, it's pretty counterproductive. Hard pass. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Earth? Yeah... While I like the core primal concept of breaking things and causing things to directly happen with force, I don't know how far I could reasonably go with this.  On the other hand, I love gardening, so being able to mix the soil, dig and do other menial chores with ease would make it easier. Human bodies all have minerals and metals, but is it plausible to bonebend or screw with a person's internals like bloodbending? The medical possibilities of mending broken bones and limbs [with Waterbending for muscles, etc.] if not just flat-out turning the human body into a Philosopher's Stone's worth of morbid bending potential don't seem to have many benefits. If I could go Magneto with metalbending, maybe. But I doubt it unless our physics become like those of Avatar. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Water? The most destructive element, but also in many ways, very useful. It's pretty much a Swiss Army knife right out of the gate. Healing wounds? Check. Healing the mind? Check? Being able to keep me dry? Sure why not. Who likes being wet?  Being able to bloodbend and correct my own body's system? Guess so. Being able to purify water from metals/bacteria/pollution? Sure.  Since precipitation and humidity exists here, waterbending would be extremely useful except it's more like a dance than the other styles. It'd take a different approach for me to adopt this.\n",

      "- Air? There's getting rid of pollution but another of doing pranks. Sure there's reenacting Darth Vader or whatever that guy in Korra's called and just being a badass edgelord with the physical training of Ezio from Assassin's Creed, but imagine being able to pass on those farts to someone else, pushing pies on people at a dinner table below instead of rocks over overpasses? Imagine being able to being so fast that you don't need a vehicle to travel? Imagine that freedom. Counter to this is my vast fear of heights if I'm not in an airplane. I know, I know, it sounds contradictory, but in a plane it's much more impersonal and secure. Just going up a ladder, or up really high heights up a mountain is pretty fucking scary when I default to worst outcomes like falling off that ladder or down a mountain to vast injuries. It's personal. Would I be able to trust in myself and the world around me to give myself that freedom? \n",

Earth bending is an all-climate solution to issues of sustenance, transportation,  shelter,  combat,  and trade. It's no surprise that the first real evidence of a non-royal upper class in day to day life is seen in the Earth Kingdom,  where bending gives local citizens a near monopoly on trade and career opportunities.  Its also where we see multiple demonstrations of soone of the supreme pre-industrial wonders of the world in terms of architecture and agriculture,  with contingent spanning self-contained megacities able to almost completely ignore the repercussions a global war for nearly a century.  It's no accident that the Avatar world manages to go from worldwide peasant farming at the end of The Last Airbender to 1920s industrial boom in The Legend of Korra in the space of 50 years. It's almost entirely due to the sudden expansion of Earthbenders in a post-war environment wher the ability to rapidly build, farm and mine ultra-efficiently bypasses hundreds of small advancements necessary to create and fuel our own industrial revolution.\n",

      "I’ve pondered this question quite a lot. The thing is, going off of avatar the last Airbender rules, everything is mostly equally powerful. For example you rarely see an Airbender’s full power because they have a more passafist lifestyle, and no sub bending group is shown. The fire nation acts like a bunch of dangerous criminals because they don’t know better, because of the way they are taught. The water tribes and earth kingdom mostly want to be left alone. If I where a water bender I would have the possibility to blood bend, that would be awesome but really dangerous at the same time, for me and others. Basic water bending can act like earth bending in which you can create buildings, but you also have an easy access for liquid form. Earth bending is easy defense and attack. Especially with seismic sense and if there are no air benders. If lucky they can also bend metal and lava. There is no stopping them. It may seem the choice is obvious, but it all comes down to your own lifestyle, gaining the ability to bend fire when your a passafist wound help you. Also the bending will change your lifestyle based on what your current lifestyle is. If you often attack people firebending would put you at the top of your life. So for me, I would like to be an Airbender but and earth bender would more likely fit my personality and lifestyle.\n",

      "Earth? Just use wind to levitate or throw stones around. You could probably use high-pressure wind or create high-frequency sound waves (since those are just air after all) to break trough rock and stone.\n",

But one can also bend water to deal damage comparable to a gun. Let's also note that water bending is a step towards blood bending.\n",

Air benders could also get their plans derailed if ever water benders gather steam in the air and choke everyone with it, even worse if they decide to freeze it and yank the whole thing out of their bodies. Lastly, water benders can support or disable any fire bender. Either choke the oxygen out of the flames or fuel the flames with more.\n",

You can erode a surface by blowing air at it. You can cool down your PC if it's overheating. You can just lower the room temperature by cooling down the air, no AC needed.

Also I feel dense solids will basically, realistically obliterate anything with sheer amounts of kinetic energy if given the proper momentum. And it's just hella practical, did you see the scenes where Toph just basically stomped the ground and made a tent or whatever made of rocks pop out?

      "While I think there are reasons to use any of the four I lean towards earth for two big reasons. First, the art of Earth bending involves, I think, the most straightforward training construct so improving my skills would be be a combination of determination and patience. Secondly, it is the only element with real permanence. You can leave a lasting legacy with things you build, and once you make a change you don't have to keep bending to sustain it.  With the exception of healing, all other bending takes the focus of the user to sustain an effect.  And I don't want to live at the north or south pole to make the same claim of water bending.\n",

      "Water, because it has natural dominion over two of the other elements, its strong against fire and (over time) can erode and even move the land to its will. A very powerful Bender could carve a city out of stone, merely by passing rushing water over it all in a way to break and erode the stone, leaving behind what they want. You could use the water to break falls or lift you into the air. If you go into blood bending you can control the bodies of other people. You can control ice, making barriers and walls to protect yourself against attackers. I think that all the elements, (water bending in particular) suffer from the same problem that the 'force' in star wars suffers. i.e. The users don't use their powers to their fullest. There are situations that are presented in which using the powers would be beneficial, or they have the opportunity to use their powers in non-intuitive and unique ways, but they never do.\n",

I don't watch the show but I know ways to set things on fire with water (superheating), I could split the molecules into hydrogen and oxygen and set that on fire, I could use water as a hydraulic shotgun (waterhammer), I can make it extremely acidic or caustic and dissolve all forms of biology and most other chemicals (universal solvent).  Ice alone is incredibly powerful as glaciers can form or destroy mountains and ice will rupture any form of metal.  Ice could make bridges or topple buildings and cities.  Water powers and feeds countries, it can dig tunnels and its the only reason life exists.  It quenches fire, dissolves earth and displaces air.   \n",

      "This is a really interesting question, because there's a handful of ways to think about it. If the question is more \"what kind of superpower do you want?\" (which it seems like most people are answering this question), then I would go with water. Mostly for the healing (although that might be considered a woman-only ability, which means I would probably only learn the basics just like I did with sewing). I don't get hurt very often, so I would mostly use it to quickly mop my floors, as an umbrella during the rain, make ice for my drinks, and honestly I would try to get some pseudo-telekinesis with an ice hand. I'm pretty squeamish, and not highly skilled at anything, so plant bending and blood bending are definitely not in my wheelhouse. \n",
      "\n",
      "But that's just what I *want*. You think benders get to choose their elements? There's a genetic factor (we don't have evidence of two pure earth kingdom citizens making a non-avatar firebender, for example) and a spiritual factor (the avatar, for one, has all of the bendings, and we have an example of two twins where one is an earth bender and one is a muggle). I'm not a very spiritual person, so I would most likely be one of the Sokkas of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let's assume I meet the bare minimum on the spirituality meter for bending, and take a look at the genetic aspect. My recent American ancestors lived on mountains. Since they're not inuits or swamp people, that probably rules out waterbending for me. This, of course, assumes that geography implies genetics (which I realize is more conplex than that, but I need some sort of foundation to work from). Since they didn't live near a volcano or around other sources of intense heat, I'm going to rule out firebending as well. The mountains they lived on weren't super high and were easily climbed, so I'd probably say my family is more earthbender than airbender.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let's flip it. Let's assume I have a well mixed ancestry, where maybe each of my grandparents was a bender of a different nation. Both of my parents were non-benders, so I have an equal chance of getting any of the four elements. How does my personality play into the philosophical aspects of the elements? (For precedent, Aang had a hard time learning earth bending since he struggled with facing things head on. Korra struggled with airbending because of her lack of spirituality, or her intense desire for conflict. I'd argue that Korra was more of a firebender, even though she was born in the water tribe.)\n",

      "To quote Iroh, \"Fire is the element of power [and desire and will]. Earth is the element of substance [and persistence and endurance]. Air is the element of freedom [and detachment and peace]. Water is the element of change [and adaptablility and community].\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not very driven. I'm much more of a go-with-the-flow kind of person. I'm going to rule out fire, and also earth. If something is too difficult, I'll usually just quit. I don't really have a strong sense of community, but my life is constantly changing, as I move all over the place. That might be a plus for water, but honestly I'm probably better described as detached. I'm also non-confrontational, and have been in very few fights (most of which I have lost). I think I would probably be more like an airbender.\n",
      "\n",

      "Airbending has flying, sure, but only the absolute masters can actually fly, everyone else has to use gliders and even then they mess up from time to time. I do like that you could run faster and jump higher with airbending, but I'm a very sedentary guy, so altogether airbending is cool but not for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firebending absolutely has the cool factor. It is certainly the easiest element to weaponize. The idea of shooting lightning is really cool too, but you have to be good at it or specially trained to shoot lightning. But, in my life I would never need firebending. I wouldn't want to hurt people, I don't ever get attacked or in a fight. The most I would need lightning for is if I could use it to power my house/recharge my phone and I doubt throwing lightning at those things would help that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Water and Earth are the two left in the running because with both of them you have a sense of telekinesis. Let's say there is a wooden  chair on the other side of the room that you want to use as a footstool or something. Firebending would set it on fire, Airbending wouldn't have much control on bringing it to you, but Earthbending could send rocks over to it and \"grab\" on to it before moving it to where you want it to go, same with Waterbending. This is a HUGE deal for me because I'm lazy and I would want the telekinesis aspect of it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Earthbending has so many cool possibilities. If you were really good at it you would get metalbending or lavabending. But, if I'm really honest with myself, I'm lazy and I wouldn't train that hard. I doubt I would get access to any of the higher level stuff. The main reason I wouldn't choose earthbending is because I couldn't easily use it in my house without wrecking the place. I have pipes and wires and a foundation to worry about underneath my house, I can't just have rocks shooting up in the middle of my living room without breaking the stuff underneath. This is a no go for me.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, my choice would be waterbending. Not because of bloodbending, or healing, or any of the advanced bending stuff. Because, like I said earlier, I doubt I would have access to any higher level bending like that. Just let me have the simple water/ice/ fog manipulation that most waterbenders seem to have and I'd be happy. I live in Houston, Texas there is humidity everywhere here. I would never be far from a source of water. If I'm ever thirsty I wouldn't have to get up to get a glass of water, I could pull it from the air and chill it myself before drinking it.
