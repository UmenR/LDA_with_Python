They used to be only the publisher. The story of Respawns creation is why I couldnt care less about EAs involvement. The other part is that it is Free to Play. EA is literally paying to have me play a game developed by Respawn. They were the original Infinity Ward right?One time I bought madden 18 ( made by EA) I sold it like a week later to a guy for 5 dollars more than I bought it for and I asked him why he didn\\u2019t just go buy one and he said cause he hates giving money to EA. Strange people out there haha I couldn't* care lessOh god, they bought Respawn?

I'm not going to buy any of the overpriced cosmetics, but it's too good of a game to skip altogether. I hate ea and still play the game Yeah, I hate EA, but made my bf download and try it first. I was told it was great, so I started playing. I'm addicted.Meh.  I don't like ea either but Apex is a good game.\\n\\nI don't like sushi but if some sushi started to be made out of skittles I wouldn't mind going to a sushi place.Your friend has principals. Given the shenanigans EA has got up to, I can't blame him for not wanting to support a product with their name on it.\\n\\nYou can do what you want, of course. But you should respect their decision.\\n\\n**Thanks for the silver, kind Redditor!Yeah I take issue with \\\"dumb hatred against EA.\\\" EA is a terrible publisher who has ruined beloved franchises and otherwise promising new IPs by inflicting their cash-grab business model on the studios whose games they produce. EA does not care about gamers or producing high quality games. They only care about their stakeholders. That means the only way to get them to stop ruining games is to stop buying shit with their logo on it. \\n\\nThat said: Respawn is great. Apex is great. Apex is free. Supporting this game as opposed to Anthem, for example, signals to EA that gamers want *quality*.\\\\*principles - principals are the bosses in schoolsThere\\u2019s nothing wrong with supporting a shitty company when they do something right imo, surely it will encourage them to keep doing it.Yeah I am under this mindset as well. I was one of those people that wouldn't ever support EA but honestly I'm not gonna pass up on this game. It's too damn dope and I can tell a lot of love and care went into it. Basically seems like EA has nothing to do with it so this one gets a pass buuuuut fuck EA though, I love respawn though. I will most likely just not buy anything with my money but if I end up doing it then oh well. This is a rare situation for me honestly. Meh. Playing the game isn't supporting them. They don't see any revenue on a free game download. I would understand if they refused to buy skins/battle pass thoughIt's free. You dont have to \\\"support\\\" ea if you play this game. Just dont buy cosmeticsWhat shenanigans?You should still respect your friends choice, regardless of your opinionThere is nothing Dumb about hating EA, nothing at all.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nLike I only started playing the game after a week it came out due to the absolutely glowing reviews by people that usually dunk on EA hardcore.It's not really a dumb hatred.Yeah regretted instantly putting that, but I\\u2019m not sure how to edit it out EA BADRespawn goodPraise Geraldo!Upvotes left.Can we get Geraldo as a new legend?ACTIVISION BAD SO EA GOOD Surely EA not as bad as you purport?Yes, they are.I understand people\\u2019s distrust of EA but to think that they had any hand in the development of Apex is just misguided. [This interview](https://www.gameinformer.com/interview/2019/02/04/respawn-discusses-entering-the-world-of-battle-royale?_gl=1*15ymrr6*_ga*bTZkUlE3SHNlT2VET2dJaDl5RzhmOVM1U2JuRlB0NTF1N3hUMG0tODFHMTFXeVdUQXNhTWpTNWdsNVVfWG5Ocg..) with a Respawn exec shows that EA was so uninvolved with the development of Apex, that they were surprised with the final product. But most people just equate mtx to bad business practices (and in most cases they are) but Apex is a free game with an insane amount of polish and I can\\u2019t think of a studio more deserving than Respawn.It's not development, it's the fact that any money Apex makes goes to EA. The game itself is great.And then you look at the prices for a skin recolor.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBad EA, Stop it!I hate EA too man (Mass effect...) but Apex is from Respawn and they need support because EA at launch of Titanfall 2 used they like a trash can and they didn\\u2019t deserved that.\\nRespawn is a very good company and as you saw almost no advertisements were used on Apex. Not a marketing tattics just EA doesn\\u2019t trust they\\u2019re guys.But supporting this game will send EA a message.I came to this same conclusion.  I wouldn't be surprised to find this game was, initially, pretty low on EA's list of potential cash cows.  Suprise EA... You got bamboozled.\\n\\nDisclaimer: I don't know what I'm talking about.Send a message that F2P and MTX are the future of games... great message.r/gaming he sounds like he's from there lolUnderstandable but this game is free and way too good not to play imo. It isn't really a dumb hatred.  EA has done a lot to fuck over gamers, release shitty games, and in general destroy any trust gamers have.  I wouldn't blame anyone for assuming a game from EA sucks and is filled with microtransactions.The fact that there\\u2019s a \\u201clink steam account\\u201d and 0 marketing or beta before the game makes me say respawn had way more say in this game compared to EA.Jim Sterling hates EA as much as the next guy but he's still playing Apex.Tell him to play, but buy nothing. He will be using the servers EA had to pay for but giving them nothing in return, resulting in a net loss for EA.I would look at it the opposite way, support the games and products you want to see. If you make a game like this as big as possible, companies will try and duplicate it. If you want to change the industry, you need to support the good ones as much as you boycott the bad ones. \\n\\nIf apex becomes EA\\u2019s biggest new title in some time, I suspect they would want to try and duplicate its success in the future, being the profit driven company they are. Yeah then we\\u2019d just get the exact same BR for every IP. That\\u2019s not gonna be that great.I honestly admire his ability to keep to his principles. Why does everyone just believe that EA has nothing to do with the project just because a PR for Respawn said so. Lmao. \\n\\nSo with that logic the pitchforks should be aimed at respawn for an 18$ weapon cosmetic cuz EA TOTALLY didn\\u2019t play into those cards.It wasn\\u2019t just a PR person, it was an actual head developer if I believe correctlyI think its okay to have your lines you set yourself to not cross, and never supporting ea in any way is a perfectly reasonable one. I personally told myself I would never touch an activision game again (other than overwatch) after they fucked me with destiny.No, he is taking a stand. Good for him. You should respect that.Taking a stand? You mean not wanting to play free a game? If anything he's making it better for ea by not using their bandwidth, its good to have morales but this is just kinda stupid imo, its just a game, not like EA personnaly stole from him or hurt him, it's just a bad company Have a few friends like this. Honestly good on them for sticking to principals. I just don't care that much - valve, activision, ea, they are all scumbags at the end of the day. EA bad\\nUpvotes to the left \\ud83d\\ude0eI\\u2019ll play with you if they won\\u2019t lol.Really? What system? I told my friend to get it on the first day to play with me and he told me \\\"fuck apex, it looks trash\\\" so I asked him what he was playing instead. \\n\\nDude said \\\"autochess\\\". \\n\\n\\nAUTOCHESS. \\n\\n\\nNow he's trying to play apex except he's cheeks and the rest of is have already found our frag squads. I'm sort of with your friend. But, it's free to play so I'm into it. Tell him he's actually costing EA money by using the servers.who doesnt hate EA?\\n\\nsomehow respawn has managed not to be dragged down by this shitty company.\\nMeh I don't really care one way or the other about EA. But I don't really and never really have liked any of the franchises they owned aside from dead space and a few older franchises. I also, however, don't buy loot boxes or any other form of microtransaction. The last free game I was really in to was also an EA game called \\\"battlefield heroes\\\" so since I spent a lot there I just don't on any other free games since I learned my lesson a long time ago. You would have a bigger voice if you played the F2P game and just didn\\u2019t buy loot boxes. People need to realize that half the time it isn\\u2019t the developer that\\u2019s cutting corners and looking for cash grabs, it\\u2019s the publishers. Support Respawn by playing their game, that way when a majority of players aren\\u2019t spending money EA can\\u2019t blame it on a bad game design rather a shitty loot box system. Look at Overwatch which in my opinion is a a damn near perfect loot box system. I bought the polished game, and never have I felt pressured to buy loot boxes. I bought them because I enjoyed my time. I feel like these companies have it all backwards. You should want to buy cosmetics because you enjoy the game not the other way around. Can't fault a man for having principles. Most gamers have serious instant gratification issues. *thanwell it\\u2019s understandabler/gamingcirclejerkI respect this man and disagree with him.There is no ethical consumption under capitalismWhy?Then EA what?His lossI almost feel the same way but it's so damn good I had to crack and support that shit companyTell him that EA didn't do anything at all, just basically funded the making of it. They only have to put their name on it for legal reasons\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEven if it's not true (I'm not sure if it is or not) it might help convince himYour friend is right. I had some real problems with a EA refund once and almost didn't try Apex because of it. And now I'm here sitting on over 20 wins and hours and hours of playtime.I'll never understand why people won't at least TRY F2P games with friends. Video games are serious business Anytime you want something from him, that is his, you should tell him EA made it, so he needs to hand it over.dumb dumbCan you blame him? I almost did the same. If I didn't see the Respawn logo, I'd have never installed it.I see we have a fifa player...My friend is the same, we got him to download it and complained none stop about fps and lag and glitches, even though hardly any. Then started to blame hit reg. All in 1 game. He went in with ultra negative attitude since its published by EA. Pretty stupid.But do they hate Respawn? Cause like it or not, the future of Respawn is in fickle bloodied hands.EA badI'm the same way with NC Soft after they shutdown the best game ever; City of Heroes. And for what? Guild Wars 2? Yeah, that went far.I won't buy anything from EA, except if it's from Respawn.I play apex, but im pretty sure that whenever EA put the battle pass for sale It Will be a scandalProceed to convince him ,first game crash. never see him again.Good for him. Plenty of shitty anti consumer practices done by EA and Activision and they will continue to do it as long as consumers don't hold them responsible and are eager to pick up their newest games because they like the devleoper.I can respect them not wanting to support anything related to EA.Tell him if he plays and then never buys stuff he's actually costing EA money causing them harmI did18 dollar skins, ea touched this. I don\\u2019t blame himMy friends hate apex because they play fortnite, I play apex alone :(, no one of my friends undertand how good is apex. And I became better on fortnite playing apex haha.Can't blame himTbh I'm just waiting for the pen to drop on EA fucking this thing up. This battlepass will be their first chance. *Checks his player card*\\n*level 3*\\n*0 kills*No point trying to convince people like that to play it. They've already decided they won't like it before they've touched it.Yeh im not happy about it being even looked at by EA but i am enjoying myself. If i had to buy it i would not be playing however.Just tell your friend that the game is not by EA but unfortunately has to use Origin to playMy boyfriend had this view for the first week of apex\\u2019s release. I played it with my friends, was talking about how good it was but he just refused to touch it because it was from EA. He\\u2019d been playing FIFA for over 10 years and had just sold FIFA 19 after being so pissed off with the game when Apex dropped, but he gave in and plays it constantly now. Still refuses to spend money on the game though! I'll be honest, if apex costed any money, I wouldn't have gotten it. I would and have not given any money to EA since battlefield 4, and until they fix their shitty greed. I'm not spending 18$ for a skin, especially when I actually have to spend 20$ on the skin because you can't just spend 18$.Sounds like Soviet WombleMy friends exactly the same. Except he is playing Anthem. What? A lot of people don't know just how bad EA is. It's not just overpriced DLC's, Pay-to-win microtransactions, it's actually down right *evil* stuff. Stealing groundbreaking code from Bethesda, overworking their employees 12+ hours *a day* every day of the week **WITHOUT OVERTIME.** \\n\\nEA has done some nasty stuff in the past that are truly *evil* and I respect this person for seeing that and doing something about it, which in this case is not doing something.Dumb? Your dumb for not respecting your friend.I hate EA but love Apex.Dumb hatred? EA has TERRIBLE consumer practices and people are voting with their wallets and not supporting them. It may be free but the more people who play, the more who will spend money on micro transactions. \\n\\nGood for your friend for sticking to his guns and shame on you for shaming him. EA is Shit. Still i play the game cause its awesome. Ill probably hate myself after buying the first season pass and supporting also ea. But i supported respawn too, so its ok i guess.\\n\\nLet this dude do whatever he want. I can understand him but u disagree on not playing it. \\n\\nI dont find it dumb at all. The line about Acti being worse than EA i also find to be false. I refuse to buy anthem or any more games that EA has had a direct hand in. The only reason I have 120 hours in apex is because supposedly EA didnt touch game design at all, which I also feel is a bold faced lie but it helps me sleep at night to believe it anyway. Acti is a piece of shit too, but EAs pay for power BS is 10 fold worse. Especially with the whole battlefront 2 debacle. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAnthem looks like shit anyway, so I wasnt sad to not buy it. Infact I am convinced that EA wanted Respawn to release this before anthem cause they knew anthem would flop.Look at Black Ops 4 right now. I think Activision is worse but I\\u2019m not saying EA is not terrible as well. \\n\\nBlack Ops 4 has loot boxes you have to pay for that they don\\u2019t tell you the chances of getting a certain rarity there is no guarantee legendary at any point. They have game affecting weapons in the loot boxes and you can get duplicate items.Download for free, play constantly using their servers, costing them money. Never once buying anything they sell. That\\u2019s the real way to get em Same issue, origin is basically a virus tho >  origin is basically a virus tho\\n\\n^ This, Origin is the worst thing, and as much as I like this game... I honestly still think i'm going to stop strictly because i need their shitty virus filled pos software on my machine.EA is shit and deserves the hate but I think supporting a game like this sends that message. Play the game, don\\u2019t buy their over-priced cosmetic crap, win win. EA hatred aside (because I hate EA also), it really grinds my gears when a free game comes out, I suggest it to my friends, and they're like \\\"Nope, not gonna try it.\\\"  Seriously? Come on, its free. Literally costs nothing.  And they'll use any excuse they can think of. \\\"Don't like BR games.\\\" \\\"Don't like shooters\\\" \\\"Don't like the 'anime' art style\\\" (referring specifically to Apex on these examples). Okay, maybe the first 2 I get, but wuuuut? Anime art style? It's like they only watched the animated trailer and that was it. I get that Apex is kinda cartoony, but that adds to the charm of it for me. And then the kicker, they will berate me for not playing their $40-$60 game that is broken af and literally isn't worth my time, but i'm a dumb-ass and spend money on their game to try it with them...\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSorry for the rant...Meh, some games just don't click for some people. I know quite a few people who outright hate Battle Royales, and that's fine. I could ask them to play Apex \\\"because its free\\\" but I know I'd just be forcing it on them and they would end up disliking it because of it. Same thing is happening when you play those games you don't like with them.I can respect this kind of hatred.Meh. His loss.I understand and respect his decision.. he is missing though...I hate EA and still play,. They've continually fucked my favourite sports franchise in Fifa and I haven't played a Fifa for 18 months. This is a good game though.\\n\\n&#x200B;Fifa hasn\\u2019t been good since 13 lol (imo)Not really. If he doesn\\u2019t want to play because he has a legit reason to boycott a company, then how about being a good friend and quietly support his decision even if you don\\u2019t agree instead of being an asshole by peer pressuring him and when they don\\u2019t succumb to your pressure, post your private discussion online.\\nworse than\\\\*Than*I\\u2019m also getting flack for Then instead of Than... it\\u2019s a never ending cycle Wow is your friend, my friend? Just refusing to try out a free game that all his friends have downloaded?We all hate EA but tell them to grow up and just try the game out, for his friend. your friend has at least appropriate morals. He hates everything EA does so he won't play it. Props to him EA does something to upset people and they say they will never play an EA game again. Than a new EA game comes out and everyone plays it.\\n\\nGood on your friend for sticking to their principles.EA fucking sucks and I would never touch another game of their\\u2019s. The only reason I\\u2019m playing this one is because it\\u2019s by Respawn and it\\u2019s free.Good on him tbh. Personally I draw the line at buying micro transactions from them, but I think we all know that just playing the game is enough to encourage them to keep doing the shady things they do. Fuck EA I respect this man, Respawn (creator of titan fall+ apex) is owned by ea. I guarantee you everything you don\\u2019t like about apex is all the shit EA is involved in. I know there are not many things to complain about but just wait there\\u2019s gotta be a catch. EA didnt touch the game...> I guarantee you everything you don\\u2019t like about apex is all the shit EA is involved in.\\n\\nThe fact that the game is free is probably on EA's too. People need to end this \\\"developer is absolutely good, publisher is absolutely bad\\\" thing.What an ignorant prick. You need new friends OP.I picked up this game specifically to give EA the finger. I will play the one game of yours you specifically did not touch.They're right honestly. I know I'm not getting the battlepass if I'm giving EA moneyI honestly think the anti-EA stuff if overhyped. They made a bad game, charged money for it, then tried to charge more money for other stuff in the bad game. People felt cheated because they paid for a bad game more than anything.  They saw a good trailer and didn't play the game demo, which was pure garbage.  To make things worse it was sequel to a good game. What I'm trying to say is when you make a shitty game people will hate it no matter what and when you make a good game people will like it no matter what, like Apex. So if it is worth it, then i'll buy something. but if its not it's not but i don't really hate the publisher for pricing things wrong. Hes not coolI'm with your friend.Your friend is right I like your friend already [deleted]Ea aren't devs...\\nI can completely understand your friend.....RIP Westwood. At least your friend has a valid reason. My best friend who plays Blackout, Fortnite, GTA5, and FIFA19 but refuses to play Apex because \\\"he hated the game.\\\" He played like 4 matches total. What the fuck.To be fair, you did say it WAS free. Okay, wow I appreciate all the comments. Saying dumb was against my better judgement. I respect his opinion of course because he\\u2019s one of my really good friends. I was just really frustrated that he didn\\u2019t wanna play this really awesome game \\u201cAs far as any player is considered\\u201dHe has a point. EA does suck. \\n\\nby downloading apex, a game published by EA, hes offering more players a chance to play with him, bolstering the games longetivity that the game can stay monetized. \\n\\nYou should respect your friends choice not to play, move on and find some friends to apex with.  No reason to be a dick and try to force him to play.  Maybe later he will try it. Good on him. There are different ways to show what you're willing to support and I respect his. Personally I chose to play the game and spend money as a way of showing EA that this is a product worth my time and money. Not that this means much considering EA only care about getting the money, not how or why they get it.\\n\\nBesides this game I only buy EA products I'm interested in a year or 2 after launch when they're reduced to like \\u00a310 each, by which point they're better products due to ironing out bugs and adding content. So even when I get around to buying the rushed messes that are Battlefield 5 and Anthem I'll be playing polished experiences (Or I just forget they exist and don't buy them at all).Dumb hatred?\\n\\nReally?EA = BAD\\n\\nGERALDO = GOODEA BAD\\n\\nPRAISE GERALDOI hate EA just as much as your friend probably more so, (Activision is no where near as bad but they are still terrible) and yeah just like you said this is 99% a respawn game, and they are awesome. On top of that it's free so if you don't spend a dime on it then you don't give EA any money. What's there to lose?I would not say they\\u2019re no way near they\\u2019re pretty much pulling the same shit as EA with Battlefront. Just look at black ops.\\n\\nBlack Ops 4 has loot boxes you have to pay for that they don\\u2019t tell you the chances of getting a certain rarity there is no guarantee legendary at any point. They have game affecting weapons in the loot boxes and you can get duplicate items.To be fair. EA is worse than activision. They both suck. But i find EAs yearly rebranding of fifa and the whole battlefield mess just disgusting. Still play apex tho, pretty solid game. He is right tho. I do play the game, because i\\u015f good, but still. I mean EA is horrible at developing games. The only reason this game works is Respawn, EA is lucky to even have their name on this game.I too hate EA. I don't agree with their business model and things their CEO has said. I love Apex Legends. If it was not free to play then no, I wouldn't play it. I have my personal views, but as long as I don't give money to EA (or someone on my behalf) I can be ok playing their games.Just punch the fucker in his throat. Problem solved.It's not a dumb hatred. It's a very reasonable hatred. I suggest educating yourself on the recent history of EA.I\\u2019ve said twice, putting dumb was dumb on my part\"}, {\"author\": \"zelmo137\", \"full_link\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/atwtrd/well_that_didnt_go_as_expected/\", \"id\": \"atwtrd\", \"selftext\": \"\", \"title\": \"Well..

GGs boys!\\u201dDidn\\u2019t say a word the whole match til the end when dude clutched a 1v3 and we all hopped on \\u201clike fuuuuuuck I love this game\\u201dGGs!!!I\\u2019ll usually yell a high energy \\u201cLESGETIT BOYZ\\u201d then drop hot and be silent the rest of the game. Works 10% of the time.From me it's normally 'Thanks for the carry'.Often playing by \\\"feel\\\" rather than trying to think through situations with squad mates does tend to yield better results at times. I also notice that sometimes I do better when playing solo because with friends, there tends to be bickering about the little things that you don't get with randoms. I also find mouth-breathers to just rage or spew verbal gibberish that only pollutes my audio and makes hearing the enemy in some situations difficult. Random callouts like \\u201che\\u2019s over here!!!!\\u201d does nothing for me. I definitely win more often solo than with my friendsI usually have my mic off but if I\\u2019m getting shot in the back and can\\u2019t turn around quick enough to ping cause I\\u2019m getting shotgun blasted then I\\u2019ll turn my mic on and say he\\u2019s right behind me while pinging my death box so my squad has a general idea of where they are/were (one example) Word I wind up #2 a lot with pre-made squads and one of us (usually me) does something absurd for our strategy. I had this guy yelling \\u201cHELP ME HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME\\u201c... after he died, every time. Whenever he was shot at, he turned his back to them, running in a straight line yelling \\u201cGO SAVE GO SAVE GO SAVE GO SAVE\\u201c, whatever that means. Last 2 teams, hes being shot at, runs away without shooting, \\u201cGO SAVE GO SAVE GO SAVE\\u201c....\\n\\nSome people are specialMy favorite is the raging pinging of saving their banner after dying 400m away from where everyone else is. I was with two guys that had mics and they kept getting knocked down. Saying \\u201cthey\\u2019re up here!\\u201d Or \\u201cover there!\\u201d But not pinging anyone. They were doing good damage on a few enemies before going down, so I\\u2019d help finish the weak ones off and get them back up. I thought it was actually kind of fun.\\n\\nWe ended up winning and at the end they told me I sucked and that I stole all their kills. \\n\\nI started muting everyone after that and relying on the pinging system. When I play with special people we lose quick, but I have a lot of fun with people who use the pinging system and communicate a lot with it.Yes nothing worse than people neglecting to use the very well designed ping system. This ping system is right up there with the hold to stay locked on button for Metroid Prime. It's tough to go back to other methods after using it. I once played games with a guy for 3 years and never learned his name. Best friend I ever had. [We still never talk sometimes.](https://vlipsy.com/vlip/parks-and-rec-i-once-worked-with-a-guy-for-three-years-and-never-learned-his-name-cYDjSKEM)I was going to post this until I saw your comment. Bravo. Just don't let me hear your terrible music over your mic, PLEASELoud mouth breathing and chewing noises. Please eat the whole mike while your at it. EUROBEAT INTENSIFIESI can't even play music while I play, it feels like it messes me up.We need to be able to mute squad mates from the select screen. More often than not they have awful mics, barking dogs, bad songs, screaming moms and crying babies very loud on my ears.\\n\\nThe ping system is a bless.If I knew how, could stop playing Apex with my free time and cared enough I'd make a Pathfinder meme where his head is a smoke alarm that has a red Dot and keeps beeping. I've heard that one a lot.Anyone else think thier might be a MM system? I swear when I play solo I can usually average 6 kills a game but when I'm grouped up with friends it feels like I run into alot pre mades.I see  champions clearly in a squad while I am solo, and I see solo players being champion sometimes while I am in a group.  they might try to group solos with solos and squads with squads but it isn't always a squad in squads or always solos in solos.I do a lot better solo without talking. A LOT better and I\\u2019m not sure why. I go from being a 10+ kill per game player to getting like 1 kill and never winning when I play with a group of my friends. Not sure the reason but maybe this plays a roleThere isn't, or it is very poor at working. I run into sweaty 3s with 800 kills each with my level 1-15s what feels like half of my solo games. (I'm lvl70)I like to go in solo on the weekends and not mute the kids who just talk all the time not listening for gunshots or footsteps or callouts, it's so relaxing mhmusually happens when the other two are duo in discord and you are solo or something.Sad but TrueSo i mostly play with randoms cause i have nobody to play with but almost more than half of my wins were with people that didnt talk but used the ping system to their fullestif i had to choose between random voice chat and using the ping system, i'd choose ping system. but if people know how to ping, adding voice to that is just a plus and makes the game more fun.Won a game with two guys who got pissed at me because i looted a box for a medkit before going to respawn the other guy. They're like \\\"wow you're gonna loot first im not picking you up\\\" . We ended up killing 23 altogether, everybody held there own. But that was easily my least favorite win . Couple games later got a low level and we were pinging our asses off, no words and ended up getting the win with like 11 kills between us all and i was way happier with that one . The people who use the mics, often seem to do so to compensate them being bad. It's when the random squad understands good calls/strategies. It's usually when a two good squad mates follow a good leader. Everyone is on the same, unspoken page. Da best. Change your mind? Its absolutely going to benefit you and your team if you communicate. Your lips move while your hands can still aim and shoot. The ping is quick, but you can't do both at the same time. Talking let's you share information and play. Sad how far I had to scroll to find this. No no, it's much better with that one loud guy on the team who thinks he's the \\\"boss\\\" and then calls you trash bc you don't run blindly into a firefight to revive his dumb potato ass.  Not a word spoken and only two players team. 2 times One word - BAMBOOZLE!I've had a few games with complete randoms where no one said anything until the very end when we won \\\"GG EZ GAME BOIZ\\\" and I never saw them again.I wish we could have groups where we could team up with people who try and don't talk. (Xbox)Cause you can say it all through the ping system.I\\u2019ve never used a mic (it\\u2019s broken lul) and I\\u2019ve won lots of games. Using similar systems in other games helped me a lot to Ping quick af tho.Disagree I've been making alot of friends with people using mics My best games the only words said are \\n\\nKnocked one, two, etc\\n\\nLooking for prowler/selectfire (love this gun)\\n\\n(Damage number) (legend I hit) \\nDefinitely not the case for me. Maybe I'm just lucky and have a large group of competent players to play with, but the best games are when we're dicking around and then shit goes from 0 to 100 real quick and we all think we're dead, but we somehow survive what we thought was an impossible situation and win. I\\u2019ve won more games with randos not talking and just pinging than with my friends talking.And my best matches were with litteraly no one... like really my best kill count was when i got left to die ;-;I love seeing LWC memes used here. I've had both.More of my wins have been with zero mics than not.  It\\u2019s so cool when in addition to the ping system you get in sync with your squad mates and set up strategies that seem like you\\u2019d need mics to communicate.  \\n\\nRecently had a match where we wordlessly fell into this formation where one would snipe from a high perch with the G7, constantly harassing and drawing their attention, me and the other would flank close from opposite sides, and I\\u2019d smoke grenade while they used Bloodhound\\u2019s ult and a threat scope I\\u2019d pinged for them.  Took out a ton of squads in quick succession, and never said a word to coordinate it.This isn\\u2019t even the right use of the meme All of my wins were silent. Lol I can't change your mind because it is trueSame11 wins with Lifeline, used my mic onceCause the best players focus on the game. They don\\u2019t waste time talking about random shit with strangers they will forget in 20min. \\n\\nSome people may like that, but when it comes to winning with randoms I\\u2019ll take people who barely talk but ping over someone constantly saying how itchy their armpit is (I literally had someone talk about this yesterday) That's becuase the only people who use mics in this game are little kids. Theres nothing wrong with them playing the game but my god can they be annoying sometimes.Fuckin, no.\\n\\nMy two best games I had one person on a mic and we were talking back and fourth about slowly moving up, required ammo, health and shield packs. Where we saw people, their location, if its a solo or a squad. Where to hold up in the final circles, when we're popping ults.\\n\\nNext to that was people actively quick chatting and being useful and helpful, but you don't get a full level of info.\\n\\nMost games, no one pings anything, no one has a mic. I die due to a complete lack of info. If people say more than 2 sentences in loading screen, i usually leave You can just mute them. Tab->Squad->there be buttonz \\n\\nThe downside is, you must wait until you've loaded to the map.Pathetic.Someone has no friends :,(Someone has no friends :,(mics have been useless 100% of the time.  People only use it to shit talk, or cough and play music or for you to listen to their keyboard presses.\"}, {\"author\": \"mhmdhsyn\", \"full_link\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/atwt2e/let_iranian_gamers_play_apex_legends/\", \"id\": \"atwt2e\", \"selftext\": \" \\n\\nOver the past few weeks, Iranian gamers have been barred from playing Apex Legends, seemingly due to the restrictions.\\n\\nFor playing the game, users need to connect to servers of Amazon Web Services Inc.
