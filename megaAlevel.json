Feelsbadman Sorry but your entire outfit is worthless without a pan. always amazes me the people who ruin the advantage of having the ghillie by having a giant backpack and secondary weapon strapped to their back  Suppressor but yeah, you wanna show off your loot you gotta be decked to the brim. Glad for op though, feels good. [deleted] They just look cool and kinda like how tim\ud83c\udd71\ufe0fs are a meme they just are. I just recently started going barefoot because it's better for stealth and every game when I drop there has been a pair of blue shoes. Surprisingly the 15X scope helped me to see someone that the 8X couldn't! Got me another kill, so I can't complain :) You don\u00b4t want a pan when you have ghillie. Truth Ghillie hides your backpack m8 On the flipside you read several people saying OP didn\u00b4t have a pan, where as the pan is actually the biggest fault you can do with a ghillie, because it\u00b4s like a big black dot in the grass moving. No pan, no decked out P18C\n\nShit load out, 3/10, would not press f Fog, has ghillie, and comp is better? ok. It's not any more stealthy to be barefoot. It's already been shown both in patch notes and from PUnknown that the volume level of footsteps is the same no matter what, the only difference is the actual tone/sound it makes. It's actually incredibly obvious to me who is and isn't on my team moving around because I can hear one jackass running around barefoot while my teammates all have shoes/boots on so it makes it quite easy for me to pinpoint the enemy running around us in close quarters. When you have a ghillie you don\u00b4t want a pan. It\u00b4s like a big black marker where you are instead of full camouflage without I find it's easier to mask the sound when barefoot and I find it harder to hear enemies that are barefoot. The effective loudness of each sound may be the same, but the sound of barefeet is significantly less distinguishable than shoes in game. Especially inside buildings where the difference of sound is a big clunck or a light tap. You also want only one weapon to hold, kinda annoying really.\n\nI see it as a novelty, like the player unknown's trench coat but in some situations it works well. Yes and no i\u00b4d say about 2nd weapon simply because use > disadvantage here in my opinion. 2 Weapons offer quicker switch between 4x and RedDot. They can have different purpose etc. But i think this is mostly personal preference."}], [{"author": "Cowceratops", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/79dhen/my_best_kill_to_date_oc/", "id": "79dhen", "selftext": "", "title": "My best kill to date [OC]", "url": "https://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/PointedHomelyAfricanaugurbuzzard", "gencomments": " [Proper Gfycat URL](https://gfycat.com/PointedHomelyAfricanaugurbuzzard)\n\n^^I'm ^^just ^^a ^^bot, ^^bleep, ^^bloop.

And to the other thread - crouch sprinting happens. Honestly you just need to get better at untoggling ads Basically what the other guy said. Shift already holds breath while ADS and it is important when you have a red dot and want to strafe and shoot. When you are ADS you should be more vulnerable and shouldn't be able to just immediately start running. You have to make the conscious decision to take down your gun and take cover otherwise flanking would not be as good of an option. Lean too [deleted] This is my #1 most desired feature-request. Call of Duty had it, and it helped make movement flow smoother. It comes down to the game recognizing and responding to what the player wants to do, and this small feature really helps. I'd rather it was kept this way.  There are already enough keys to bind. I sprint crouch a lot. So as long as it was an option id be down for it  So you're the guy I always kill \"running\" thinking he's safe moving cover to cover lol. Tip: only do that if crouch running will actually hide you on one side if running near a ridge or through BUSHES and NOT grass. I kill a guy doing that every game; it's almost as bad as going prone in a field when the circle is more than 200m diameter. I even get very consistent ranged headshots on those players as their movements are so easy to lead. Ah because i crouch sprint i must be that 1 guy you killed once aha. Keep your tips to yourself hotrod The dude just gave some advice, no need to hate/downvote No you are likely that guy (or duos team even) that gets wiped every round where they otherwise might have lived if you \"sprint crouch a lot\". You're not going to accept free advice? Well you won't improve then. I was trying to be a little comical, but if I must tell you to support the validity of my advice, I am a rank 65 Duo FPP player ~5 K/D. Advice is advice in the end and some will use it or waste it; downvoting won't make you right and that kind of stubborn attitude will not allow you to get better at anything in life :/ your choice. There's a difference between *giving* advice and trying to pretend like you are. dozens of people asking for help and advice all over the shop, he can help them. assumes because I use crouch sprint a lot i'm using it incorrectly. just so he can brag about his headshots.  I read halfway and stopped. No i dont want unsolicited advice based on assumptions that are wrong. So kindly fuck off Meh, while there's certainly uses for crouch sprinting, i agree with the downvoted guy. I don't feel like he pretends to give advice, he just does Lul well stay bad then. I just showed my duos friends this and, as top 100 players, they just laughed their asses off. If you don't even consider advice from the best then continue to get fucked by the best XD Eh I was more or less just giving a reason for his downvotes, not saying I actually think that. It's really early; should've been more clear. You know what else i do a lot i shoot guns and oddly enough i know not to point the gun straight up and shoot wildly for no reason while standing in the middle of the field. That is why i wont listen to your advice because its redundant. Because i already dont do what your saying not to do and you just give the \"advice\" so you can brag about your rankings and headshots.

Just a heads up you don't need to drop the Tommy Gun before you pick up another weapon. Just drag the new weapon over and it will switch it out Now you know how it feels to have been allowed such power, just to have a force take it from you. I feel ya man Just a headsup, next time you go for a package, wiggle around left/right while looting it. You were sitting so still, if anyone was around he had an easy headshot on you Jebaited  Oof Kinda reminds me of a game i had the other day, last 16 alive, a crate drops right in front of me on my way to a house and got away clean with an m24 and an 8x. Presume to dome one person and line up the next headshot in a 4 way gunfight only to get a connection error. My roomate bumped the router and unplugged my ethernet cable because it doesn't have clips. Feelsbadman. It just wasn\u2019t meant to be :( When you drop the gun, drop its ammo immediately. Saves you worry about space for picking shit up out of crates cause you wanna get out of there as fast as possible usually. Turn off your character render if you want more fps btw ~~esports ready~~\n\n1.0 ready Imperfectly perfect servers.                                           \n10/10 Simply outplayed  At least it wasn't an M24 or AWM, I honestly feel the SKS is better than the Mk14. PUBG: \"In time, you will know what's it like to lose\"  Recently the first care package was dropped near me in the middle of nowhere so there was noone to take it from me. I got an AUG. Maybe like 5 minutes later, while not seeing any enemies since, I was running from the blue and fell from a cliff and died. Yeah. At least you were holding the gun Whenever I go for the package. :/\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/EX3zA Life is like a box of chocolates...  servers potato Well at least it was the Mk14. I really don't like that thing! Cool :) This fucking game i was waiting hard on that one, lol I had something similar happen to me the other day while playing squads. Was playing 4 man squad and had a drop land right next to us. I get an AWM and tan ghillie (desert map). I've never had the chance to play with the AWM before so I'm a bit excited. Then another squad with alteast 1 hacker shows up and starts taking out  my squad mates. I know I have no chance of beating this guy so I just blow all of the AWM ammo so they can't get it before they kill me. Ugh, sucks man. I feel your pain. Dropped solo Georgo, had a Georgo circle. Crate dropped right next to me. Open it up, fuck yea, Groza! Great for in-city fighting. *Game crashes*\n\nFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK. (this was before you could just rejoin.) \"Computer says no\" Brutal.. I feel your pain. Had it happen with an AWM.  Lined up a sniper with it aaaaaand... **** you, PUBG, just **** you.\n\n*sigh*\n\nStart again... It's okay the MK is just a slightly better SKS with more recoil anyway. :b My bad luck is with the Kar98k. Here's why :\n1st time i get one (with an 8x) : Network Lag forcing me to quit.  \nAnother time (the worst one) : Its early in the game. I get a kar with an 8x. I take a bike to get to the zone. I jump off a little hill, fly for 2-3 seconds, and I land on ANOTHER bike on the ground and it explodes.I was pissed.  \nAnother time : I find a kar, \"host closed the connection\"\n\nFuck this gun 10/10 E SPORTS READY -Played a game yesterday, where our squad actually got 3 drops, saw a total of 5 all within 1km, ended up with 2 guys on the team with Gillie suits. One of each color, the tan and then olive one. Was great, we finished 2nd. Of course this was on Miramar, an why you'd have 5 drops occurring inside of 1km on that huge ass map Idk but E sports ready! Don't worry, the MK14 is absolute garbage anyway. Didn't miss out on much! My first package had very similar loot! I died 2 minutes later to a win94 at close range. better luck next time :) What resolution (graphics)  is this? LOL\n\nBeen there man. Right after they introduced the Groza, two friends and I decided to play and go for every care package we could. We each got one. Everyone had a ghillie, full lv3, groza/AWM/mk14, 8x+4x, and tons of meds. We made it from Stalber to Mili... and right when we're about to attack a squad... HOST CLOSED CONNECTION. All three of us were booted. I wanted to be more mad about it, but honestly, it was hilarious. That goddamn AWM curse strikes again!!! How did your keyboard hold up? lol nobody going to mention that he needs to keep his weapon out and ready for when someone shows up? having your fists out isn't going to do you any good. man you're slow with looting With 17 people alive you should have dropped one of your weapons prior and made sure you had enough space in your backpack for whatever bullets or attachments came with it...\n\nYou were so slow I expected you to get rekt. Did u win???  Be happy. 7.62 guns are all dumpster-tier these days... My pubg group says this aaaalll the time \n\n\"Pubg giveth, and pubg taketh away\" lol Away {-}7 Thanks! Yeah I knew this before and I have no idea why I threw the Tommy Gun on the floor before I picked up the Mk. Just the excitement of using a gun I've never used before override all my reflexes \ud83d\ude05 User name checks out. although in this case i would have preferred to be headshotted \ud83d\ude2d At first I thought that was the lucky part, not getting shot while sitting like a target lmao I keep reading this as jailbaited. \nWhat does it actually mean? Place some tape on the connector, it won\u2019t fall out so easily. yeah i'm not in this habit and usually end up carrying ammo for the last 3 weapons i was carrying :( the mk14 is like a hyped up SKS You can use it to full auto, has more.damage and less recoil. If shroud believes it\u2019s broken I believe him. Get a car and jump on top of it Yeah except you know you're getting the coconut one. mix of high and ultra i think. played at 1080p, recorded at 720p :) What keyboard?\n\n(\u30ce\u0ca0\u76ca\u0ca0)\u30ce\u5f61\u253b\u2501\u253b I mean, he didn't use the truck as makeshift cover on the crate, he stood completely still and he took a solid 5 seconds longer than he needed too looting. Lots of mistakes here, but oh well Thee wilt at each moment beest thankful f'r what thee has't f'r thee nev'r knoweth at which hour pubg shall taketh t hence {-}7 You were right in throwing the Tommy Gun on the floor. That's where it belongs. You've never used the Mk14? That's just adding insult to injury. At least the gun you've never used is nothing too special. Basically an SKS with five more damage and more recoil per second.\n\nDoes have full auto though. Yeah atleast _someone_ wouldve gotten the mk14... Ffs Also move the car up to the box to provide yourself cover ya dingus its an emote on twitch Doesn\u2019t it actually one shot lvl 2 helms tho??? Well he can 180 degree spray down an enemy full auto with an 8x MK14 within 20 meters. Hardly a metric for us plebs. it does 5 more damage than an sks and hsa far more recoil than an sks\n\n\nits just a more dangerous sks in all honesty The only thing broken about the MK14 is how bad it is. Not good. As if there was ever a car nearby when you actually need it.. This looks so much better than Xbox. Isn\u2019t the Xbox version 1080p? {-}7 I\u2019ve only had it a handful of times and have yet to fire a shot with it. I call it the bad omen gun because it means certain sudden death.  Mk14 absolutely fucking destroys. Definitely something special.  Good question I dont think so but it does more dmg then the SKS. nah, but it does more damage than the sks and has full auto mode but slightly more recoil No, it only does 5 more damage than the SKS. Sometimes less depending on the armour. 60 as opposed to 55 when the recoil is far greater isn't really worth it. I never pick up an SKS or an Mk14 unless I literally have *zero* other options, as I hate them both. :b More to do with textures and fx. The Xbox version turns off and down pretty much everything.  {-}7 Get out chanka no one called you dammit! Sounds like me every time I find a silencer for my SMG/AR ... instant death.  It does 5 more damage than an SKS. It's nothing special other than the full auto mode, lack of foregrip compatibility, and more recoil. There's no inherent reason to pick up an Mk over an SKS unless you're only going to be one- or two-tapping people's helmets. Even then, it's barely five extra damage, still can't one-shot a level 2, and has no foregrip slot yet a higher default recoil.\n\n\nThere's nothing special. I feel like the Mk14 is overrated. The insane recoil makes it not worth it. Meaning more detailed textures in general? Do not disrespect the lord!\n\n{-}7 I haven't tried the AUG yet but MK14 is my top pick for a crate weapon. Better than the AWM (takes 7.62) and more versatile than the m.24, combined with a bi-pod of you REALLY need to let off some ranged volleys. Not to mention that fully-auto mode if you need to put someone down who is sneaking up on you.\n\nThis baby can 1v4 easilly, I know first hand.\n\nAlso while we're at it... VSS is incredibly underrated as well. With an extended mag I trust it as both a SMG and a medium range sniper (that nobody can hear) got a 7 kill squad win yesterday using it paired with the m4. 4 vss kills, I recommend really giving it a shot if you can find a clip and cheek pad. I mean, to each their own i guess. I'm basing my opinion off of personal experience, and in my personal experience the difference between the sks an the mk14 is noticable. The difference of 5 damage is hardly negligible when compared to the damage value of other markman rifles. Not to mention it has higher bullet speed and selective firing, giving you full auto. With an extended mag you basically have an AK that does 12 more damage at a much higher muzzle velocity. I maintain that the mk14 is something special. I destroy with it.  Yeah resolution is nice but isn\u2019t as noticeable as texture qualities typically. Since low quality textures are still going to look shit at 4K  The VSS is underrated by everyone, I'll agree. But saying the Mk14 can 1v4 easily is the same as saying the SKS can 1v4 easily. It does five more damage. **FIVE** . It also has *higher* recoil than the SKS even with the bipod, is louder, and doesn't take a foregrip. There is nothing special other than the full auto if you have like a red dot on it. That's it. As a sniper it's just an overhyped SKS.\n\n\nThere's nothing special. If you like it that's your opinion and I respect it, but saying it's a \"top pick\" is way too much of a stretch for me to agree with. It literally does five more damage than an SKS. It's like comparing the M24 to the Kar98. Yeah, the M24 does more damage and is probably better to have, but saying it's something special is simply untrue. Yeah if you like it that's your thing, not mine. :b Can't tell you what not to like but I do have a problem with this:\n\n\n> The difference of 5 damage is hardly negligible when compared to the damage value of other markman rifles.\n\n\n\nYou do realise the difference between a Mini and an SKS is 11 base damage, right? Yet the difference between an SKS and a crate-exclusive with more recoil is only 5? The Mk14 has the highest recoil per second in the game and for what? Five extra damage and a 6% bullet increase? I'll take my gripped SKS. :b It's a top pick for me, I didn't say for you buddy.\n\nbut its still an easy choice for me, because it's still easily the best DMR in the game, which is arguably the best medium-range weapon-type in the game right now. I'm not a headshot machine, otherwise m24/AWM would be my wishlist.\n\nI'm curious whats on the top of yours? M416 for medium range\n\nUMP + suppy for close\n\nSKS/M24 for long simply because of the SKS's higher stability and foregrip attachment M4 all the way, why UMP over vector though? because i rarely play alone and the chances of getting multiple extended SMG mags are rare. :b When I get one for myself I swap for the Vector, though. Although 4x on a suppy'd UMP is basically a quieter VSS with less drop and more dps. :b I'm pretty sure the UMP silenced sound got increased to match or be comparable to VSS. And extended SMG mags tend to be pretty common for me (I am always on the look out)\n\nThat being said, I am inspired now to consider the silenced UMP. Meh, the UMP still has the reduced recoil, higher muzzle velocity, and rarity over the VSS. One of my main squad has no idea what video games are and is solely there for comic relief, but there have been times when I've looted him and he's had six pistol mag attachments, no assault rifle, and only 12 gauges as ammo. He tends to hoard the good attachments lol. Just this morning I was playing duos with him and I was like \"hey do you have an extended for this Vector?\" and he said \"mmm, nope\". Ten minutes later we get into a fight where all of my 13 bullets hit but I have to reload on the second guy.... looted teammate's body and he had three extended SMG mags. smh it happens far too often. :b If it's not that then it's just not finding enough for all of us since I prioritise myself last, as I'm objectively the best of the main five. (sounds cocky but only i have a positive kd and can control recoil xd) But it's okay the UMP has done me wonders <3 This game seriously needs a practice range. If it had a COD style testing range where you could get like a diamond rank for timing and accuracy (with lots of tips thrown in), I bet the entire player base would get a lot better. Hell I'd be a lot better off I got to practice on moving targets.\n\nThe lobby on Erangel never seems like a good place, but you can get a little recoil practice in I guess, which I've done.\n\nAnd yeah duh, we woould all be picking the groza over every other CQB haha!

It's too hard to shoot drivers with a controller. It's more difficult to hit drivers, but happens all the time. People are just dumb from my experience and don't even attempt to shoot the cars.

Tried dropping a popular place for the first time in a month--military Erangel. First 30 seconds after landing, my buddy dies out of nowhere. 2 seconds later (30ft away, no windows around), I die in 2 shots to the same guy who has a [89 K/D ratio](https://pubg.op.gg/user/DouYumum?server=na). RIP any kind of anticheat. Dude just kills the entire server in the first 3 minutes of every game. I'm just upvoting all the cheater threads/region lock threads. Let the masses be heard because it is ruining the game for so many of us. It's not almost depressing it's very depressing, can't even play my favorite game .. well it was my favorite game. Not anymore because I can't even play it without Chinese scum ruining it and when I play squads chances are 1.5% I find someone who speaks English  Played about ~10 games today and had three very obvious hackers. Guys scoping through mountains, blocked terrain at people they can't see, 100% HS rate, etc. Not everything has to be as obvious as standing in the middle jumping in a circle headshotting 10 people in one second, but it's obvious enough when you scope at people through mountains that are one mile away, and you insta-head shot everyone. Pretty much anytime I hear the crazy-silenced single shot going off I can guarantee I've just wasted 30 minutes of my life. That's really depressing. Playing FPP isn't an option, because they can just go there too. Weak.  Do they even ban for recoil macros yet? I know they'll ban AHK scripts, but there are scriptable mouse drivers. China is blockimg vpn soon. Hopefully lowers cheaters Come to Xbox lol have you tried not being good at the game? I'm terrible at it, and if there are cheaters, it doesn't matter because non cheaters kill me just as quickly, so I can't tell the difference. Hope that helps! play fpp Ive been killed through a mountain 3 times in the last 2 days. Seems to be more of a TPP thing than an FPP one. I never play TPP and haven\u2019t seen a single hacker.

Give it a week for the ban wave, pain in the ass but that's gaming these days. always play fpp and I had no encounters of cheaters for about 2 months. ps i have high rating and 3-4 kd i do play only fpp these day, it's also a bit interesting and a little more challenging \n\nyou should try  tbh i play fpp duos/squad/solo and i encountered cheater maybe 3times in total 400hrs. i play EU. dont know what u guys still crying about I dont play tpp most of the time but when i get to play it ppl are rly low skill and tend to die like morons tbh.. I'm not saying there are not cheaters im just saying alot of ppl love to blame it on hacker when they die. nauseating to have the camera flip/snap when its locked FPP\n\nor just plain easier for hacks to detect other people when you can 360 with freelook in tpp [removed] was his name PingXiaoJing or 1928479374924?  Most kills in a game 52...  Although I agree a large percentage of the hackers are chinese, I have seen a lot of normal names cheating too so, lets not put all the blame there. They're all scum in general though. I mean, I've made some friends just off the fact we speak the same language now so I cant be too upset.  \u201cChinese scum\u201d \nAll hackers aren\u2019t Chinese. \nBut the closet racists have come out.  Yea they should. It IS cheating.  THIS is what I run into most.  \nIve run into a few blatant cheaters since I just started playing a month ago, but what *really* pisses me off are the people using subtle macros. Getting mowed down full auto through a 4x enrages me to no end. Especially when I have to literally pull my entire arm down 12\" to compensate for recoil when I try doing anything similar. It's just a slap in the face everytime I get the drop on someone and die because the killcam shows literally zero recoil. Won't rlly do anything unless bluehole region locks Its what I did today.. Thought itd be bad, but I've finished top 5 twice and top 10 twice in 4 games Id rather play with cheaters at 144fps then no cheaters at 15fps Except this game gives you headaches in fpp and movement is like shit fpp is just full of fucking macros. Can't they just play fpp too? Or do less of them go there?\n That isn't how it works Please don\u2019t remove this post... it\u2019s there for a reason. To raise awareness. You\u2019re hurting the entire community by removing a post that games this much traction. Please dear god I  beg you. \n\nThere are so many other posts about this, why does this one have to get removed? Please reconsider ... The banwave? My friend, the number of cheaters hasn't ever really gone down, only gone up. A banwave isn't going to cut it anymore.  It's not easier to detect. The information is sent regardless of whether or not you have visibility. But it may be harder to catch because people probably just assume you third person peeked them.  I mean, to be fair the game and perspective is also garbage. I enjoy FPP more because of how fair it feels but at the same time I play TPP more because it looks and runs smoother. I get a little motion sickness from FPP as well lol [removed] Truth DouYumum. Close enough? Don't worry, Battleye is on it. /s I'm not saying all the hackers are Chinese only the vast majority, and the language barrier is just annoying not being able to communicate with my own team I love that somehow Chinese became a race instead of a nationality? It's not racist. here we go Hardly any blatant cheaters in FPP. There are probably quite a lot of them, but they aren't as obvious  they can but i see maybe 1 in 50 games I can only go from my own experience, haven't seen any cheater till today since 1.0 came out. They've banned 1.5m accounts and no-one has any real figures on the number of cheaters other than that.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/7o9ag1/there_are_so_many_misconceptions_about_anticheats/\n\nThat's as good a post on the reality of cheating in PUBG as has ever been posted on reddit.  > nauseating to have the camera flip/snap when its locked FPP\n\nIt also feels like you're looking through a window, the FPP fov is fucking terrible even at max settings. im thinking theres a lot more cheaters now who are from eu na bc of the chinese plague wave. alot of european names using macros now thinking its the only way they can play with a chance of winning. Either way, bluehole have lost control fort oo long, shits gonna stain there long term image unless they can salvage this asap. IMO they should have brought the ping lock in months ago, now everyones cheating, not just the billion chinese players Bigot , racist , xenophobic , piece of shit , Donald trump, throw them all in the same bucket. Ban waves isn't going to help anyone. Why?\n\nIt's because of the way licensing works in Chinese net cafes. Anyone can come into the net cafes, create an ID and play the game without having to purchase the game and bind it to the Id. What this means is that when that account gets banned, they will simply create another account and play the game with cheats however many times they want. This is why they usually have random numbers and names.\n\nIt's really stupid how they set this up. personal experience huh? Well unless you only play fpp or are really low rated that would either make no sense at all or make you one of the luckiest persons on the planet. \n\nI watched jeemz stream some TPP yesterday, out of maybe 15 games 12 had at least one cheater in them, most had multiple. The other three they died early in pecado so those might have been clean or might have had one in them as well.  The ban waves generally come after they've patched the exploit - I meant the fix and subsequent ban wave. I play TPP and according to the leaderboard i'm in the top couple of percent. Yesterday was the first time I encountered cheaters. I've no idea who \"jeemz\" is but pointing out that that they saw cheaters yesterday doesn't run counter to the point I was making. jeemz is a streamer that plays for penta. There are other streamers as well that if they play tpp, they regularly see cheaters. From personal experience, a few friends that play casually stopped playing because they don't like fpp and they are tired of having all of their games ruined by cheaters.  I've no idea who penta are although I think we're going round in circles. Don't know what to say other than I haven't seen cheaters in 1.0 till this weekend where we saw 4-5 over the course of maybe 20 games. Not sure what is so unbelievable to you about that. Thinking about it, I've only seen them on the new map don't think I've seen any on the original one yet. There is no selection option for maps yet, so that you haven't seen them on the new map just a coincidence. Might also depend on your playstyle, hackers usually don't drop to places like school or military because they first need a gun to do their thing. Guess you've just been lucky.  Or whoever jeemz is got unlucky. Either way point is we've seen this kind of mass wave of cheaters before in the alpha and it got resolved within a week. My original point is that maybe BH should be given some time to patch it and deal with the cheaters rather than have every second post being a video of some cunt with an aimbot like no-one is aware that there is a cheating epidemic at the moment. well not just the one streamer that I mentioned, there were plenty of others that played tpp that had the same issue.

You just needed a duo. Lol this was a singles map and you had that many teamers? Is there a way to recognize and just blanket ban people like that? Most I ever ran I to was 4 on a singles server... died to the 4th guy in the bathroom... but damn man good job  I'm so proud of you. Most of these videos of teamers the player gets swamped immediately, but you fucked them hard in the arse and then some. Props for standing your ground like a man and killing so many. Wish you could kill them all them lousy bastards REGION LOCK THE DAMN GAME ALREADY You did well bro. Well played I don't get it. This game strongly disagrees with teaming. But the bus has 6 spaces when the maximum for a team is 4 people. Why did they make such a big van? These china cheaters and teamers are never going to get perma banned. They are such a big market that PUBG will lose their sweet sweet profits. \nThey would make more money catering to these cheaters then they will the rest of the world. your guns sound a lot different from mine and i want to know why Aww I was really rooting for you Nice try *china player Thank you for doing your part in thinning the herd. know what, i'm going to say it: china's gamers should be firewalled from the rest of the world's until they can figure out the spirit of fair competition.  This happens in plenty of games and is a purely cultural phenomenon.  devs, dont break our games in the name of \"inclusion\" I'm not usually one to culture hate, but sheesh, Chinese culture really seems to encourage cheating. you were raping, and that's all that matters. You stood your ground and took a bunch with you. /salute You held your own. That is honestly the dumbest thing I've seen in a while. These people are worse than scum.  Seriously, PUBG, just restrict all Chinese IPs to the AS servers or a dedicated China server. They can have all the fun cheating they want and not poison the rest of our playing experience. \n\nTheir Chinese Government has banned VPNs iirc so it would be hard for them to get around it.  Reminds me of Forsens PUBG gameplay Just fyi, there are far less asians playing on first person servers. That's why they added the Van..\n\nFucking school bus NEXT! boys REGION LOCK IS XENOPHOBIC REEEEEEEEEEEEE they look like bots without cheat Bloody red shirts, we know where you political allegiances lie... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEciRB9pbKw  Out of curiosity, given the amount of concurrent players why can't they just place RNG based delays in once you start matchmaking? Anywhere from 0 to 10 or 15 seconds. There should be enough matches populating that it would throw a wrench in trying to sync with others.  it's almost like a zombie game, where they are streaming at you like lemmings, but they just overwhelm you by sheer numbers Not buying any crates or giving another yen to Bluehole until they block China from other servers. Region lock when? What the actual fuck. lol R E G I O N L O C K Wow they suck! No need to be xenophobic aye? Way to give em hell though. Proud of you this is my game every match, everyday, full of chinese players hacking, teaming, hope someday bluehole figure this out and put some region lock tool.  That boost in KD though... the gatekeeper\n\nduty fulfilled Boy they\u2019re not very good Every solo squad que I've been getting is Asians. The last game they come to pick me up, jump out, and shoot me. All I hear is \"China numba Juan\" Don't be xenophobic!  Let these guys do what they want! daddy, whats a zerg?\n\nlet me show you this vid son. I think I played against you in an OCE FPP solo, u killed me as there were 3 left you were at a wizard tower on that hill west of gatka. i was tryna nade the tower too much wheres that shroud random duo when you need it? never see anything like this in FPP\n\nmaybe i need to go back to toilet mode\n I'm so done w this game. My friends and I have switched to Escape From Tarkov and we are loving it so far. Hoping all the cheaters and what not stay on this game. The guys that develop EFT actually care about their game and make sure its running good and isn't a chinese wild west like PUBG China #1 Just give us an unlimited squad mode on global servers. Give the people what they want. \"Asian teamers\". Well okily dokily then Careful don't get run off the subreddit this game is perfect and you must conform to that. They have such a big group they dont care about running in the open which is why its so easy to kill them\n\nEdit: also op is good That was the exact same thought I had. RIP Jaime Lannister. holy shit I was thinking exactly the same thing, he did well under the circumstances tbh these are internet cafe players...one person tells everyone else in the room to hit 'play' the same time as you so you team up and troll for a round. \n\nits wrong and a justifyably bannable offense but i dont blame them for trying. its controlled chaos regardless of squads vs solos. they just look at your shirt and if its not red they shoot.\n\nit would be very easy to tell whos teaming based on proximity stats vs time, but remember, its bluehole. In replay you will be able to go through and report them all when the next patch hits the live servers. > Is there a way to recognize and just blanket ban people like that?\n\nYou could attempt to find players that remained within proximity of each other for extended periods of time, without doing any damage.  not gonna lie i've done with with 6 mates and we won. wouldn't recommend it and i was part of the losing team but yeah i mean it can be done A great slam and then some! Nah, we're just xenophobic people. Just need to git gud. [deleted] That won't stop teamers Half of this comment consists of the word \"well\". custom servers you can have up to 10 man squads im fairly certain Options for player position. I doubt if. PUBG is a huge game, but rampant cheating can easily kill off the hype for games, especially ones where the primary goal is PVP competition. \n\nUnchecked, cheating *will* kill this game. I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re anywhere close to that point, but if 12-18 months from now there is still rampant cheating to the point that it noticeably affects the average player, I guarantee there will only be a fraction of the current player base left. \n\nIf the only people playing are cheaters, the game is dead, and Bluehole gets shit. \n\nPlus, how does Bluehole get money by *not* banning them? They get money by banning cheaters, who then buy a new copy. But that of course requires Bluehole to ban them in the first place. So In fact Bluehole has a financial incentive to ban them as quickly as possible to maximize the frequency with which they have to buy a new copy.  I agree. I got downvoted earlier for implying/saying that but it\u2019s true. And there\u2019s a combination factor of what I perceive as shitty development.\n\nPUBG has already hit its peak IMO. can you even ban them if they play in an internet cafe? is it their account they are playing on or does the cafe provide the keys? I don't give a shit if they cheat, but can they at least be on their own servers and not NA? They need to add a 50v50 mode and then people can team without fucking up the experience for everyone else you can virtualize 7.1 surround \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/6rtbcb/guide_every_headphone_surround_virtualization_on/\n\n*note: this used to be a bunch of manual processes, he recently updated the post after making a small exe that does it all for you.* Who the fuck downvotes this lmao He may be using a sound equalizer software, which alters the sounds output from his device to the headphones, which alter the sound in windows/obs/shadowplay too. Yes, just like how torrenting was made illegal and now no one torrents in the US. /s\n\nWhile I'm sure it helps thinking it's still available to the people who are resourceful. Check out the forsen and shroud duo. Even more insanity  i know, i replied to another comment saying that on OCE from like 6am until late morning some days the FPP queues die off (and im impatient) so i just queue TPP and fuck around :) Needs 20 seats. NEXT! Bluehole doesn't care about cheaters because they make a lot of revenue. They easily could've come up with logical solutions like yours months ago, but they didn't. I have sometimes played with 11 other mates on the same server, we pick random teams, jumps in 3 separate Discord groups and one of us on each team streams.\n\nAfter the games we often watch the best moments, the times we actually faced each other and how close we were. When one of the teams gets wiped, they can still multitwitch the streams, and it's hella fun!\nSo no, I don't want this, this would make our entire group stop playing... And no, we don't use this as an advantage, we are streaming so you would know that  Lmao Bluehole\u2019s thoughts exactly. In all seriousness they know, but they\u2019re too pussy to actually do something about it. don\u2019t cheese me pls haha yea that was me ;) got the dinner after u died xo ikr... sucks because on OCE in the really early morning like 6am-10am theres no FPP queues so i sometimes queue TPP insted :/ You're posting this comment in a subreddit that is 50% complaints about the fucking game, you've GOTTA be joking. [removed] It's TTP it's not that hard! > RIP Jaime Lannister\n\nHoly shit TIL. A lot of notable names in that movie, too. Guess it's time for a rewatch. AN ASIAN TEAMER HORDE\n\nON AN OPEN FIELD  brb getting red shirt Sometimes my playgroup is more than 4 so we sync our ready buttons, and it is surprising how often that works. Just to be clear, we are enemies once the game starts.  It's an easy fix for bluehole, add random delay between the click on \"play button\" and the beginning of the game. The more a player has been report for teaming, the longer the delay. Why ban your best customers? If China buys 1 million copies of the game every day it would be financial suicide to stop them from doing what they do. At the end of the day Bluehole is a company and a company is not in the business to entertain you but to make as much money as they can.  \n  \nSaying that tho, i played 4 games of squads last night as a solo player and got put in with a group which had cheats, a group that grouped with 3 more teams, an all random group which sucked, a few Americans which ended up with us all chatting about the USA and it's current crisis. > its wrong\n\nIt's smart. That sounds tedious as fuck so basically every hacienda drop ever.... fucking campers. That's ping lock, not region lock. Can't they just spoof their pings? Yeah that doesn't help me because sometimes my ping will jump from 20 to 300 then back to 20. Living in LA,in an old building with shit infrastructure isn't gonna help much if it's just a ping lock.  \u201cThere is no eta\u201d\n\u201cWe hope to provide an update soon\u201d\n\nThis means nothing is happening in corporate speak \n\nSorry to disappoint. Bluehole are a shitty Dev who will never change until we all move to another game  Well now... Fair point Sadly, even games like APB where almost every second player are cheating are still alive. Other games like Rust, where cheaters run just as rampant as here are still popular. And even games like battlefield have a lot of them, but people still play all those games. \n\n> So In fact Bluehole has a financial incentive to ban them as quickly as possible to maximize the frequency with which they have to buy a new copy. \n\nPeople won't buy new copies if they know they will be instantly banned.  Anecdotally, three of the four friends I play(ed) with have quit the game over the frequent blatant cheating. Me and my friends already charged back the game, and we do not care lol.\nOut of last 10 games I have had aimbotters kill me 8 times... -.- How does not banning cheaters make Bluehole money? Yes you can ban them with ease even if it's the cafe's keys. Any internet cafe worth a damn wouldn't let people install 3rd party programs that could get them banned. If a cafe is allowing users to cheat they deserve to get banned just as much as the player.  Is this even a question? Ban the IP. I don't give a fuck is some net cafe can't access the server anymore. Shouldn't have allowed your customers to install hacks on your systems.  me i am inbred You cannot get around ping blocking no matter what you do  Yea, i've been watching all his vidoes and those were some of the least chaotic, still fun to see shroud and timthetatman realise how bad he gets steam sniped. Same here past 10pm, fpp servers either slow down or just stop  [removed] OCE FPP queues die in the early hours of the morning so sometimes i queue TPP Its hackerfest tpp which automatically makes it harder than fpp. tbh FPP is easier (I play only FPP) Pretty sure Tom Hardy and Phil from Modern Family is in it too Man, that was the most epic vid. We do this aswell. It's a good laugh when you get in a firefight with your mates, not really knowing if it's them or not until you down/kill one of them.  Yeah I have no problem with a group of friends playing together, as long as they actually play by the rules and kill each other if they're in different teams. The problem is when people use this to play like 20 people as one huge team and then that's just so unfair for the other teams. Do you play pc or Xbox? And remove the fucking game hash at the bottom of your screen that lets you know whether you're all in the same game instance or not. Why this made it into the released version of the game is beyond me. Hand a ban, they buy a new copy. Win win. Except for us, then it's just lose. I mean you can't report teamers you can only report the player who killed You. What'd you expect. [deleted] Ping is heavily dependent on distance. The packets have to travel somehow, and the theoretical limit is the speed of light, in practice its much lower. If you're in china it'll be borderline impossible to get <100 ms ping to NA even with a perfect route. No Well well well.\nDid bro played? >\tPeople won\u2019t buy new copies if they know they will be instantly banned.\n\n...well they DEFINITELY won\u2019t buy a new copy if they aren\u2019t banned at all lol.  Rust and Battlefield servers have admin. Punk buster actually tells you when it bans someone which is nice. Private servers can also implement additional cheat protection if need be.  it doesn't, it loses them money in the long run. But a shocking number of people forget to apply Hanlon's Razor.  If those cheaters engage in the Steam market they can earn Bluehole money.\n\nThey can earn a lot of BP, spend it on crates and sell the good stuff. Buyers pay commission and Bluehole gets the money.\n\nThough I doubt it's worth it, the legitimate player base earns them a lot more money in the long run and not banning cheaters will cause them to lose the playerbase. The cafe's install the software for them the customers don't need to do it. Customer is always right. Also China not USA what internet cafe's think it's ok to do there will be different from ones in the USA (do internet cafe's exist in the US still?). Good Right but VPN ban != ping lock. The person I was responding to was talking about the latter; You are mistaking that to be about the former.\n\nI agree that a ping lock is the best solution and is the hardest to circumvent. Yeah I'm in the same boat, only I'd rather play on NA with 300 ping than switch to TPP with all the teamers and hackers. I don\u2019t know where people get the concept that fpp is more skilled. Difference is that if you are bad you will do better in tpp but if you are good then both modes are the same. I\u2019m already 1900+ on both and climbing. I used to play tpp exclusively and just started fpp a week ago and already top 2% and still going up. When Modern Family first came on I actually recognized Ty Burrell from Black Hawk Down. His \u201cnext I\u2019ll whip you boys up some margaritas\u201d line always stuck with me. Legolas was in there too. Sadly, he was not able to see the action because he fell from the helo. Yeah, I watched it again after finding out that Tom Hardy was in it, didn't even notice he was Twombly. And Jeremy Piven too, he's Cliff Wolcott.  Context? I mean thats how it was in the begining... some hilarious moments were had. Once was when me and a friend adopted a guy in duo's cause his teamate died. I dont feel teaming really matters, the amount of loot division amongst that many players puts them at a disadvantage. Pc [deleted] So like their own Steam?/Uplay/Origin?\n\nWould they pluck the game from steam when this comes out? Spoofing ping is so easy that when ping lock goes live most cheat sites probably won't even charge for it. k Well, bro well played. I don\u2019t know what Han Solos razor is but I think blue hole recognizes their inability to really make this the game that it could be/should be (or the higher up guys do) and they\u2019re just milking the fuck out of it.\nIf they really wanted to end this cheating epidemic they could. Or they could severely impact it. But they don\u2019t, so it must be greed or they\u2019re idiots.\n\nUntil then this game is almost unplayable. I have over 500 hours in it but the last time I played I was killed by absolutely blatant hacking in just under half the games I played. I don\u2019t have the patience for that shit so I\u2019m done until it\u2019s fixed. Which is probably never. One mention of Hanlon's Razor and now it's in every thread.  Yes but not as they traditionally were. Less of an Internet cafe and more of a \u201cgaming lounge\u201d. Tons of those where I live.  whats a good lol is that a new covfefe? i love trump If good players are even in both, and bad players are better in one, then that obviously means the one the bad players are better in, is the one that takes less skill.  Yeah I'm top 0.2% or something on FPP, and I'm pretty sure FPP isn't any harder or more skilled than 3PP. It's just a different mode, which is even probably harder than FPP because your decisions and positioning matter even more because good cover/positions/tactics give more advantage than in first person. You need to be more careful and think more in 3PP. That's why I don't play it :\\^) Should've brought his shield-board. And Obi Wan Kenobi [deleted] yeah but if you have the advantage of numbers you can usually just kill other players and take their loot, so it ceases to be a problem after a while Is it seriously that easy to aim on pc? I\u2019ve only played console and I couldn\u2019t do that in my wildest dreams Which is a bannable offense Maybe? China usually forces foreign vendors to use local companies for distribution so they can be properly monitored and censored. Some times they do this through a new client, other times its a launch option. For example, Perfect World runs DOTA2 in China and you can launch that version from any client. It then asks for additional login credentials you probably won't have unless you're Chinese (I don't remember if you need to associate it with government ID) to connect to their private servers. So even if they keep it in steam, they will essentially be walled off for Chinese players. If so, I can't wait to see how far the concurrent players on Steam drops. use this www.google.com to solve your ignorance of Hanlon's Razor That's probably cause  this entire sub is 450kish people forgetting to apply it.  It is true and it is false. It is an advantage everyone has. People who play fpp complain that in tpp they get peaked and waited on and die. I have that issue but I don\u2019t mind. It is an advantage everyone has. So playing tpp means you have to be more careful and I usually am. Fpp it is easier to get the jump on someone and tpp I usually need to be more coordinated with my team to take a room cause usually someone goes down. Same shit different flavor. Grimes' grind Whaaaat? Never noticed him there. Lemme check. HOLY SHIT LOL /r/ActLikeYouBelong I love that every time I see. Wow, what a wild ride\n\nI know PC Master Race and all, but I'm glad we don't have to deal with this bullshit on Xbox I love that video so much...\n\nYes, that is what I meant. That is hilarious!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cTKsA2igvM\n\nthis is just fucking amazing :') lmao Idk i like to play FPP 1 man squad so to me it sounds like a fun challange.  I mean, Ive been playing shooters on pc for years and years and if you sync your aim settings across games you are basically bringing tons of built in instinct and practice to every new game you play. If you switch to PC it will take time to get good but yes it is demonstrably true you can aim better on PC (with practice!) It was a joke... Gold Coast Blend But not nearly as entertaining as this!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cTKsA2igvM wtf are the downvotes for lmao..this sub is so fuckedup the han solo bit was a joke sure, but the rest of your post made it clear you actually didn't know what Hanlon's Razor is... I thought it was funny man And spud from trainspotting! Had to get money for that scag somehow.  I googled it. It\u2019s really simple, I just don\u2019t agree with it exactly.

Given the huge player base we could probably assume it is impossible for BlueHole to actually get through all of the reports manually. And I\u2019m sure many of us feel that the submit report button is as good as flushing the toilet. \nBlueHole need to balance between taking an iron fisted approach with cheaters and not cause collateral damage by banning money paying players who aren\u2019t actually cheating. \nI know someone who got their account banned for cheating (he was actually using x-ray and no-recoil), but after an email simply saying he wasn\u2019t cheating and BlueHole unbanned him, as the burden of proof is very high to ban someone who brought your product with money from using the product. \nWhat if we also had a soft punishment that essentially matches the \u201csuspects\u201d into the same server? Now that PUBG has an easy way of capturing user reports, maybe they can run some data analysis and determine some sort of threshold to put players into the naughty corner? Maybe something like if you receive 30 reports over the most recent 8 games\u2026 then you go into the naughty server for 5 games or something\u2026 or they will be back on normal server once their report/game ratio is below threshold, but if they get large number of reports again on their first couple of games, then their report/game ratio would push them back into naughty corner\u2026\nThis way BlueHole won\u2019t have to worry about accidentally perma banning non-offending players, and in some way shields honest players from cheats while they investigate. And as long as most of the player base is honest about cheat reporting then we should be able to isolate a significant portion of the cheaters to play with themselves.

I like this idea, but I really don't think BH is gonna implement something like this soon. and what happens if players decide to report a player every time they die to someone?\n\nthat player might be a skilled player but get reported alot (because they are legitimately good but because you die to them you report), that skilled player would rack up ban reports and be put in the \"Naughty Corner\" as you called it anyway.\n\nImagine if that happened to a guy like shroud, people report him just because he is good, and ends up in a lobby full of hackers for 5-10 games, gets through that only to play 1-2 legit games and go back there again due to scrubs reporting him.... Nice idea in theory but what if legit players get shadowbanned and dont know it? Is there a tldr available?  Text wall is too painful I would guess that if they have the know how to implement a soft system that tracks user reports over the last x games and weighs your suspiciousness based on that, it wouldn't be too difficult to also implement a system that essentially gives 0 weight to reports from players who report someone every time they die.\n\nStill, there is the potential problem that very high skilled players can get inadvertent soft bans and I can't think of any easy automated solution for this. Basically they'd have to manually flag players such as shroud \"really good\" so that they wouldn't be banned by this system. It's like, 2 paragraphs of text... How is that too painful ffs? yeah and i guess that is the real issue.

Depends on how you like playing  FPP is going to be a bit harder generally due to limited field of view.  Have to play a bit more mindful of surroundings.  TPP and FPP are imo two different modes which drastically changes the way you should play. In TPP even when you are healing e.g. behind the rock, you still have 360 degrees view and you can see what is happening on the other side of obstacle. Same with houses, walls - you do not need to peek to check what is going on there. TPP rewards camping even more because of above. Yes.  The free look and the camera angles are bs in tpp imo. I mean, u can walk right up to the end of a wall, and free look around it. Because of the way it\u2019s setup, it\u2019s easier to spot enemies and therefor, that promotes more camping.  But on the flip side, TPP offers a wider FoV, and the ability to view behind you, around trees and being able to see over ledges and through grass when prone. These make offensive plays much more difficult, while defenders get a huge boost.\n\nI wouldnt call one harder than another (besides all the hackers in TPP, making the climb to top 50 or so vastly more difficult). Just different mechanics and balance. If you're good at one youre going to be good at the other. I disagree. Because FPP limits FOV, players tend to camp more to avoid being killed by blindspot attackers. TPP players will run across an open field more often than FPP because they can see 360 degrees and feel safer, regardless of whether or not they really are. I see the exact opposite. I think players are more aggressive in FPP because they know they can't be spotted by players TPPing around a corner. You can be more aggressive on knocks, pushing building, etc. In TPP, you always have to assume someone is behind a wall, tree, etc. Therefore, people don't want to play nearly as aggressive in TPP.\n\nI think there are way more campers in TPP than FPP. And that's due to the nature of the perspectives. At least they can't see around corners and over walls in FPP, though. I like FPP for a bit more realism."}], [{"author": "Fatalblade015", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/7vrvgq/average_mylta_start/", "id": "7vrvgq", "selftext": "", "title": "Average Mylta Start", "url": "https://clips.twitch.tv/ProductiveChillyMarjoramGingerPower", "gencomments": " Well, there go my headphones."}], [{"author": "Vilteysingur", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/7w0niw/how_about_raising_the_price_of_pubg_too_60_so/", "id": "7w0niw", "selftext": "Just a thought I had.\nHackers spend more after ban on a new game.\nMore money into the game development if they still buy after ban.\nGame can go on 60% or more sale on steam sales.\nGame has the player base it needs too be healthy.\nThoughts?\n", "title": "How about raising the price of Pubg too 60$ so hackers will have too spend more money on each game?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/7w0niw/how_about_raising_the_price_of_pubg_too_60_so/", "gencomments": " China and other places can get licences for as little as $5.

The goal is to be the last one standing.\n\nIf you're getting downed and killed so much, maybe stay close to your squad, instead of being greedy and looting a whole town on your own. Revives are already broken as fuck (OP). Knocking someone from a distance who has cover and a teammate nearby is nearly worthless. Are you denying the fact that people are backing out constantly and losing a good amount in the early? I rather have those ~3+squads into the mid game to keep things spicy I'm pretty sure it's an issue for a lot of people. And i don't really land hot, we don't go pecado/hacienda/school but it's quite lame if people vindictively go to finish your team mates. why are you assuming it's me getting killed? It's usually my friends, and no they're going out of their way to die while doing an execution so they won't be standing much longer > Are you denying the fact that people are backing out constantly and losing a good amount in the early?\n\nNot sure where you got that from. Watch replays man Where did I say anything about backing out? ah i thought you were saying i was making it up.

Their loot system confuses me, it seems like theres just \"themes\" for each game, per building style It's because there are no doors. Some other buildings have as much loot it just takes 10x longer to get because you have to open a thousand doors and go up and down 5 flights of stairs.

How long has it been now? \n\nI love FPP and at this point playing TPP just feels strange, but unlike a sizable portion of this sub I freely admit to preferring it because the skills I developed in countless hours of CS and other FPS games translate really well and I like not needing to deal with my opponents having access to the camera, not because TPP is super EZ mode full of bouncing 8 year old potatoes.\n\nYet every TPP highlight post, discussion, video, whatever the hell else is constantly littered with comments about how the OP should \"try it on FPP\", \"TPP players so bad\", \"lol this is why I don't play TPP\" and whatever else. We get it. You like FPP, you like feeling superior over another group of people, you like the circlejerk. It doesn't need to be in every thread.\n\nIf people want to have a legitimate discussion about FPP and TPP modes, the different skills needed for each, the advantages and disadvantages? Great. I love reading those and I love participating in them, where they're appropriate. Let's make a monthly megathread about if you want to harp on about how much better you are, whatever. \n\nThere are two game modes and some people like one over the other. Both of them have very good players, both of them have very bad players.

While I agree with you...\nwhat are the disadvantages of TPP? Please.. just a few. its has more obvious cheaters.  [deleted] Offense isn't *easier* in FPP. It's certainly more fair though. There's a significant difference. You can attempt a flank and either be successful or caught out and shredded. [deleted] It's tilted towards the defender in TPP. That's what I meant by \"fair\". [deleted] Unlike some, I'm not here to say you're a bad/lesser skilled player because you play TPP. That's completely juvenile and unfounded. What I will say is that there are too many situations where a push/flank attempt is basically suicide due to the TPP camera. Tempo Storm got 1v3d today in Starladder simply because they forgot they were playing in a TPP warm up match. They're obviously talented players. The knock on TPP isn't the skill of the players.

He waited 4 seconds and you were 70+ meters away, impossible.\n\nNot even mentioning the fact that he's obviously wallhacking while carrying cheater's kit on him with all the best stuff in the game. What will they come up with next...inb4 instant transmission pan headshots I just had this happen tonight as well. Sad thing was the guy had hundreds of matches played. \"Ban Waves\" are missing quite a lot. Had this happen the other day. Getting shot at from over 300 meters away then somehow he throws a grenade and kills me from that distance. Not really new, but yes. Guy killed me and my buddy with nades perfectly to our feet from ~100m the other day. I thought the disappearing player in the map was the coolest cheat.. then I saw a flying scooby doo car cheat and was like woah this is better. then I see this cheat and Im here like WTF headshot with a grenade this is the best Saw this a couple of times recently, grenade throws over amazing ranges with pinpoint accuracy on opponents the grenade thrower could not have seen.\n\nHere's where the fanbois come in to defend Bluehole against unfair criticism. But i have played 1200 hours and have never seen a cheater /s Such a great game idea, executed as such a steaming pile of shit... Not aimhack.  \nHe has wallhack and a grenade hack that drops his grenade on your position.  They don't even seems to care about hacker anyway, i made a post about one some weeks ago and got an answer from the support telling me that they're investigating his case, yet he's still playing with insane stats :\nhttps://pubg.op.gg/user/GucciHpk?server=eu\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfdpD8EJoBI\nAlso, i figured now that that guy did the same trick in my record. Not auto aim. Just sees people on the map [removed] He has a strong throwing arm did he launch it over 300m tho This Or maybe he\u2019s literally to legit to quit Play first person and you never will Held the grenade for 4 seconds after popping the pin, and it hit the guy 100 meters away instantly. \n\nThat's grenade teleporting, so I guess that's a thing now.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS) if you have any questions or concerns.* Kinda right.. the dev team calls it a \u201ccold state\u201d when you\u2019re not on high alert and your weapon is at rest. \n\n\nThis feature has always been in the game, just that now there\u2019s an animation to this.  Wait, really\n\nEdit: It makes sense the way they do it with ARs and such, but like, my pistol isn't taking up any less space, it's just leaning They did this is the new orientation, each weapon has a rest phase when not in use  What do you mean kinda right? \"cold state\" if just a name the devs gave the feature so that it sounds cool for people like you. The effect of this feature IS that the weapons take up less space when they are not in use, which is why the game designer implemented it. It\u2019s purpose is not really to take up less space in the screen. It\u2019s main purpose is to add to the realism as when you run you do not run with the gun up so it takes time and by doing so after the sprint the gun is set to a lower position. What I mean by \u201ckinda\u201d is they didn\u2019t add this animation so the gun would take up less space on screen. The hot and cold state has been in the game. They just added the animation. The cold state is supposed to be another part of the game design to feel more realistic. ie; when you\u2019re running full speed with an assault rifle, you\u2019re not ready to draw your rifle up to aim immediately. Your weapon is lowered naturally by running at a full clip. \n\n\nTime/record the ads from both hot and cold state if you have the tools and you\u2019ll see that it takes slightly longer to ads from cold state. Similar to how it is in real life. I\u2019m not saying this game is supposed to be 100% replica of a real life aiming and shooting techniques, but rather a feature to add to the immersion of the game. Saying the devs added this so \u201cthe gun takes up less space on the screen\u201d makes no sense especially since they\u2019re planning to add weapon skins. As much as we ridicule the dev team, I can think they can spend their time on other things to improve over the idea of \u201chey, let\u2019s lower the gun after 3 seconds so it doesn\u2019t take up as much space on the screen in the fov.\u201d"}], [{"author": "WiseHallucination", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/86pbck/comparing_shroud_drdisrespect_reacting_to_the/", "id": "86pbck", "selftext": "", "title": "Comparing Shroud &amp; DrDisRespect reacting to the almost same things, is it entertaining?", "url": "https://v.redd.it/h6nfgyfgpln01", "gencomments": " If some one gave me $5k id lose my shit too. Two different personalities, two different target audiences. Watch what you like. nice compilation. personally i love them both. doc brings energy and shroud is just plain fantastic at the game. If you're asking if this video was entertaining then yes it was.  Seems like it could be a good way to introduce different (or similar) streamers to fans of particular streamers. I feel like Shroud is who we all aim to be, calm, collected, level headed, but we always end up like DrDisRespect when we get a win. Is the video entertaining? Yes. Do I also appreciate the fact that you didn't link to some YouTube page you're trying to promote? More than you can possibly imagine. Edit: Go check out OP's YT channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSEeuA7mp6YaLFpMcvZWwyg/videos) Love shroud for his humility, Love Doc for his over the top cockiness, two ends of the spectrum, with the two of these streamers on I am always entertained. Love them both shroud is a humble ex-professional gamer.\nthe doc. is an actor.\ncompletely different types of entertainment  This is why i liked them play together.  2:30 : that victory speech gets me everytime Can someone explain to me how someone watching someone else play video games donated 5000 dollars to someone on purpose? What is the point of this? The thing I love most about Shroud is how fricken calm he is under fire\n\nHe can be shooting at a duo across the way, then get shot at from the other direction, look over that way, then see a vehicle in the distance, start shooting at that, while both groups keep shooting and barely missing him.  He's then just decide it's time and he'll spin around on one of them and headshot knock one guy, then finish the other off.   Then spin to the other group and completely outplay them.  Then look back at where the vehicle was, see that that guy got out, find his head peaking over a hill, head shot him\n\nThen after all that action, just matter-of-factly look over at his subs and start thanking people.  It's like...how do you not only DO THAT, but be so damn chill the whole time.  It's unreal It\u2019s a shame that the Doc has switched to Fortnite.  nothing against shroud, but from time to time he looks emotionless Who would have thought a character created to be larger than life would react more strongly than someone that's been playing comp esports for years Shroud plays himself\n\nDr plays some obnoxious unbelievable character  Doc fundamentally is different than Shroud as a character.\n\nShroud is an ex-pro, he is retired, he plays games as a craft.\n\nDoc is an entertainer, his career is trying to hype up a crowd, he plays games as a medium to accomplish this.\n\nYou could make a direct comparison to one of Doc's memes of the arena. Doc is standing in the middle of the arena and every person that walks in that he destroys he hypes up the crowd - no matter how strong or weak the opponent is, it's almost always in his favor.\n\nShroud on the other hand, doesn't care who cares, he doesn't care who is impressed, he is always just trying to see if he can \"do\" something. Can he shoot 900m and get a headshot? Here let's try!, Oh cool it worked.\n\nDoc could hit a headshot at 100m and freak out more than Shroud does at 900m. #TeamLirik \n\nwe miss you. Let's see a ChocoTaco reaction vid too. You think Shroud is chill? Think again. it is entertaining. Thanks. you forgot to add in the 99% of the time that the doc plays pubg at a potato level and then rage quits before his first game is done.\n\nis it entertaining? are you watching someone play games or just throw a temper tantrum? I definitely appreciate the video. I'll respect that they serve two different styles of entertainment, however, I do not care to watch the doc's stream. He's a good player, probably a good guy, but the persona just rubs me the wrong way. And here we see a quick summary how to make it on twitch: Either A) Be ridonculous good at gaming or B) Be entertaining AF. Both perfect to represent Twitch as a platform! I love them both \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Two completely different types of streamers, both bigly successful. Fun to watch.  Wow, shroud looked so much younger when he first started. I guess the salt gets to all of us. What is the song name at the end, /u/WiseHallucination? I say they are two different streamers with two different target audiences. I love watching shroud to see someone dominate in the most smooth and natural way possible. I love watching Doc to see someone dominate and make me laugh my ass of the man is fucking hilarious. This made me feel bad for shroud. Something good happened to him and he thought it was fake and seemed upset. Dr. Disrespect was, by contrast, exuberant.\n\nThat said, I enjoy watching both streamers!\n\nThis also makes me wonder how much of Dr. Disrespect's character is manufactured. Kind of like Stephen Colbert, if that makes sense. i enjoy both streamers  This unexpectedly blew up, I woke up to a very pleasant surprise! Huge thanks for the golds kind strangers! You've give me the motivation I need to do the things I love and if that wasn't enough, you all gave me great feedback too. Thank you all, this is the warmest welcome to reddit for me!\n\nBeing new to Reddit. I don't know how I can edit my post to say thanks for the gold, so I'll just leave a comment here at the risk of it being completely lost in the myriad of comments.  Watching this makes me miss the old doc. The face of twitch doc, the funny to watch and confident doc. The not awkward to watch doc. Ever since his cheating fiasco watching him and watching his stream just hasn't been the same. Doc has said that Shroud is the best in the PUBG scene, dunno why there's a pointless fan-made competition between the two lol Aculite>Shroud>Choco>disrespect This video is exactly why I enjoy shrouds stream and not the doctor\u2019s.  hairydix LUL I\u2019d like to see them react to negative things. Getting second place. Dying to an obvious cheater. Dying not to a cheater, but still a bullshit kill.  i have never seen so long video on reddit, nice Even rich people dont give that money for nothing, i think they give their selves that amount of money so people would think that its normal to \"donate\" to someone that isnt in need  That was amusing!  Long shot\n\n\n*Shroud: hmmmm wonder if I left the stove on\n\n*Dr Disrespect: Holy shit waffles! My hair it's on fire I love shroud. so chill  Videos in this thread:\n\n[Watch Playlist &#9654;](http://subtletv.com/_r86pbck?feature=playlist&nline=1)\n\nVIDEO|COMMENT\n-|-\n[SHROUD FIGHTING A DRAGON IN CSGO (PART 1)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8c0CYJ94o)|[+87](https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/86pbck/_/dw76cw4?context=10#dw76cw4) - I think its the one where they jump on chairs and kill a dragon?

And next we have Wadu reacting to the same situations. Shroud is so damn boring streamer. Only reason to watch him is because he is good at the games. Shroud reminds me of dish water Wow great work op thanks  To be fair doc is the entertainer and shrouds the pro  These guys are nothin..... ugh i hate when they deadpan to camera Shroud seems like a cool guy and Doc is a maniac. Both are fine if you like.  I can't stand DrDisRespect. He's such a piece of shit. The first video I saw of his he killed some kid in game (between 10-15yo judging by his voice) and Dr called him a worthless piece of shit who needs to go cry to their mommy. There is no sense of humility in his character and he is embarrassing. \n\nShroud, on the other hand is humble and a much better player.  shroud is a real person. doc is a made up person. (like a wrestler)\nshroud is playing the game. doc is playing the game and entertaining.\nit\u00b4s pretty easy actually. if you dont like the doc charakter, just dont watch him, and watch shroud instead. easypeasy. enjoy your day Shroud's great at the game (any shooter, really), but he has almost zero personality.  shroud not, probably he is very boring in IRL too. dr yes he is entertaining. You dont even have to play good to entertain people Yep, thanks for reminding me why I don't watch Doc with headphones on. Too much damn yelling. It was fun, I love them. Doc is the goat streamer no denying that. Ninja is great fortnite player but sometimes acts too childish nowadays. Old ninja was really entertaining for me. Shroud is for gameplay you want to get better watch shroud. You want to be entertained for watch Doc. Simple. Nice video, docs the best Person playing a role vs a casual dude. 17 kills in duo game vs 30 kills in solo game. OMEGALUL D OMEGALUL C Two different styles and I like both. I thought the Doc would be fun to watch, even before the whole wife thing, but I just can\u2019t stand how fake he is. The whole thing is so cringy and his community literally just regurgitates the same crap since when he started. \n if drdisrespect didn't look like that maybe I would watch. Hey man amazing video\n\nMaybe do on couple more streamers? Did we ever find out if those huge return day donations doc got went through? Or did they chargback? Am I the only one in here subscribed to both? Doc and Shroud are nothing alike except that both are fun to watch (for very different reasons). Do you guys only like 1 TV show at a time, too? Shroud almost double the kill.. yessss Well edited! You are sure to get a nice amount of subscribers!\n\nIf you want some easy subs, you can also do the offlinetv highlights. There are not many doing that atm. \n\nWhat's the outro song? Do more of these videos please this was so funny for me to watch  It's almost like one's a character putting on a show I definitely prefer watching shroud. He is just so chill all the time and I like that. Doc has way too much energy for me. All these clips of Doc were Pre Cheating Doc when he was great and fun to watch his energy was high and his persona felt natural. But Post cheating Doc is pretty damn cringy to watch now.  His Persona is way different and i don\u2019t enjoy his content not \"For all those saying its a fake helicopter, heh, your an idiot.\" \n\nI fkn died.  Great idea for a video. But they also are my two favourite streamers so my opinion might be subjective :) \"For those of you saying that's a fake helicopter, you're an idiot.\" Great ending love the Doc I don\u2019t love me dr disrespectful  [deleted] Why would someone donate upwards of $5k to some kid gaming? And what does it go towards?  Bros. You are just seeing the natural them. Call Doc what you will but that is him around his family, when he's in the shower, when hes driving his car. Same for Shroud.\n\nAnd another thing they are both entertaining to watch when they are together. \n\nDoc is the one who who goes in full throttle and Shroud is the silent assassin. I can dig it. \n PLAY SOME MUSIC YOU IDIOT don't they both play fortnite now? A very humble man. Shroud seems normal. Yeah, but how long can the Dr keep this personality. I can\u2019t imagine having that always be in the back of him mind when streaming games. At some point it has to die, it\u2019s easier to be your genuine self, which is why shroud is a great streamer. When you watch him it is him.  back when doc was king  We need someone comparing glitches and bull**** deaths. Is this really a surprise? One is a character, over the top one aswell, and the other is just a normal guy whos been doing this for a long time too.\n\nI honestly think that shroud's reaction is the right one. People often donate for a streamer to make a scene out of it and make them feel good only to recall that donation later.\n\nIt would be funny to see how many of these big time donations actually went through. \"*exhales* mmmmmmmmm yessssssssss.\"\n\n\n30 kills and so fucking calm I love it.\n\nDifference in Shroud being Shroud and the Doc is a character. Guy wouldn't act like that by himself. He's more laid back. people have to stop giving these 2 attention, specialy doc. dr is a shill Dude this was so great. Love them both and I hope they continue being awesome. Made my day Dayum it feels good to be the best! XD\n\n This is fucking awesome! :D\n\nGotta ask: is DrDisRespect putting on a show with the wig and the sunglasses or is this just his natural being, by which I mean does he wear these things kinda sorta usually? Doc has the twitch thing down. Gotta give him credit wheres credits due. Shroud is beast mode, never seen a stream but a clip here and there, that guy is mean with keyboard and mouse. [shroud in a nutshell ](https://youtu.be/WrcZvF33px0)  I prefer shroud he's a god. I find great play more entertaining. It's the difference between someone good at the game and an overhyped unfunny cunt of a streamer like DrD which I have no fucking idea why people watch or donate to. Dr Disrespect is overrated and stupid. i like shroud becose he not fake. i dont know who is disrespect irl, but i know who is shroud.  I think Shroud is more entertaining by a lot.  Very entertaining watching two different people paying the same game! Love the both This is why I can't stand watching the Guy Beahm at all. Old Doc pepehands This is the most ridiculous video I have ever seen... why would you even spend time making it? Its a different level of fanboy... take a break from video games my man.   I\u2019m not salty at all, I was just wondering who sees this as a worthwhile thing to do. Nothing more.  [removed] This is more /r/LivestreamFail material but entertaining nonetheless  Dr. D. is the guy you and your parents hope and pray doesn't end up dating your sister.  He reminds me of Andrew Dice Clay, even though it's an act, at some point you have to wonder if playing the role of jerk for long enough doesn't have consequences.\n\nShroud seems like a regular guy who is obviously very, very good at something (clearly better than Dr. D. by a mile) but hasn't let it go to his head.  If you had to go on a long cross-country road trip with one of these two guys, you'd be okay with Shroud--Dr. D. would wear out by the second or third day.\n\n\n Shroud is indifferent and DRDisrespect is a massive wanker.\n\nIt's pretty much par for the course. They played Fortnite together, and honestly I think Shrouds chat was so full of food hate that it was kinda pathetic.  You should crosspost thing to /r/fortniteBR  \nSomeone made a thread with a skin suggestion based on the doc and 99% of the comments were nothing but hate about how he's toxic, doesn't deserve to be recognised because of what he says about the game, and the same repetitive jokes like \"2 timing champion\".  \n  \nHere it is just look at all the fucking hate they spew about him. https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/85jdm5/skin_concept_the_twotime_champion/  \n  \nNone of them understand the persona of The Doc. He didn\u2019t accuse someone of cheating he made a video about cheating and said if you paid a professional coder to write hacks for you you could possibly get away with It on stage even with someone watching over your shoulder.  stupid fucking video. Shroud sucks. Shroud's hesitant to react to large donations because it's very easy (and common) for people to charge them back. He basically doesn't get access to the money for almost 200 days which is after the chargeback period. Where the fuck I am I'm trying to figure out why anyone would give someone $5000 because they think they play video games well. Mind you I still can't wrap my head around the fact that people would rather watch someone play as opposed to playing the game.  If someone gave me $5 i'd lose my shit. Not if you already make tons of money from streaming.. Its all a matter of perspective. 5K for a normal person is hugue, but for them, iuts basically pocket change. I beat both of them. Shroud's entertainment is that he is a VERY good player.  Doc's entertainment is that he is a very entertaining guy and a pretty good player.  Watch whichever you like better. ^ right, plus shroud has succeeded in soOoOo many clutch situations and too many to count, maybe his wins in pubg are just a fraction of winning in a tourney, I would think so.   Yeah if you look up highlights on YouTube most of the clips of Doc are about Doc reacting to situations, the clips of Shroud are stuff like \u201834 kill game\u2019 or \u2018shroud gets 5 kills in 8 seconds\u2019. I watch both.\n\nShroud for the surgical precision, DrDisrespect for the lulz. I'm really happy to see this as the top comment and it's highly upvoted. I may not like the Doc very much since his return, but his reactions are what brings his audience. To each his own. Professional Player vs Entertainer  Yeah, spot on. I mean if you have ever done team sports, you will have lots of different personalities. The guy that does all the dancemoves and scream when he scores, and the other that just raises a finger and runs back to the team. Nothing wrong with either unless you make it unsportsmanlike :) I was hoping I would see this comment here. The two streamers in question are *completely* different in how they stream... why is it so hard for you people to understand that DOC is a character. \nLook at wrestling overreactions https://youtu.be/hA0MTkHLO0g\n\n Neither, please. Streaming is one part of gaming culture today where I just can't see the appeal. It's like going to that obnoxious kid's house as a kid and just sitting there on the sofa watching him play.  Or just watch both because they\u2019re both awesome Hey, that is great feedback, thank you! You can be both. That's what great about being human.  I don't want to be calm, collected and level headed when I win a game.

Thank you for the great feedback! God forbid someone tries to make money from their efforts and instead uses the god awful Reddit video. why would you be glad he didn't upload the video to youtube? v.reddit blows. I mean if it was the same content, but on a better video player, then why not? What's wrong with linking his youtube channel if the content is similar to this? I mean it is his content so why would that bother you? Also some people might want to know what his channel is because they want to check out his other videos. I just can't see how you make it sound like such a big deal. I hate Reddit uploads. They load on mobile maybe 10% of the time. I'll never see this video. Ever.   Couldn't agree more Yep.. and the thing is, I like both personalities/alter ego  I haven\u2019t seen Dr. play PUBG for the past several days if not more. I\u2019m not sure why but I think it\u2019s because of the red zone.  Throwaway money. If you have a lot of money, it's not really an issue (we're talking about a very, very minority here). But giving 20$ can feel like a lot for most people, but they will do it because they enjoy that streamer content.\n\nThose guys and girls are entertainers. Some are better than others, some are also very good players, they can also be lovely people.\n\nNow, if someone is producing content, and you're having a great time watching that content, why not giving them money to say thanks and/or make sure that this person can keep creating content ?  Think of kinda like sponsoring a young athlete. They see someone they like and want to support them. Streamers are a form of entertainment, new it may be. People deride pleasure from different forms of entertainment. Streamers make a living directly off of viewership and donations. It is (typically, at least at such a level) their main form of income (not counting merch, sponsorships, etc.). It is a very personal form of entertainment; you're literally bringing in a new person into your life in some form. It isn't (all) fake like most scripted shows.\n\nMany people enjoy this form of entertainment more than, say, episodic forms as TV and Netflix, or films. I myself went to the movies exactly one time last year, haven't watched television in years, and don't have a Netflix subscription. I watch YouTube and Twitch- that's really about it.\n\nThe point is, many people come from financially successful backgrounds, and are privileged to do what they please with what they have. And people on specifically tight budgets (as myself) may just be able to throw a Prime subscription once a month, which could be considered the tiniest gesture of compensating for the hundreds and thousands of hours of entertainment they get in return. Either way; you're helping support a person doing what they genuinely love, and receiving joy and release from boredom because of it. It is simply a form of modern entertainment. People pay thousands of dollars for football tickets and those entertainers entertain on for a few hours a year.  Streamers entertain for hours most days.  Personally, I'd rather donate to streamers then pay for a football ticket   If I had that kind of throw-away money I would do the same for many of the content creators I enjoy. It's important to support the content you actually enjoy. One possibility for the large donations is that they come from a developer/publisher/streaming service. Seems like an effective way of supporting a streamer that promotes their game or service while also making streaming seem appealing to other potential streamers (\"Wow, this guy makes thousands streaming PUBG, I should do it too!\").  And so they, in turn, begin streaming the game as well, further promoting it. \n\nFrom that perspective, a few thousand dollars of donations here and there to a popular streamer seems like money (anonymously) well spent by a big company, compared to the potential returns. [deleted] I always assumed that those donators get their credit card company to charge it back later, so the twitch streamer doesn't actually get any money out of it. In those cases at least, the donator is doing it to get a reaction from the streamer. 15 years of counterstrike will do that. *cough* Shroud as well *cough* PUBG forever, yo. Lots of streamers have. It's sad how PUBG has fallen, especially with the recent publicity Drake has brought to Fortnite not surprised since Fortnite is actually playable on non-NASA-PCs. They both still play PUBG quite a lot. His ''lack'' of emotions during impressive plays probably originates from being a pro csgo player. In two ways, actually. In one way, he's been making nutty plays his entire gaming career so he probably got used to it. In the other way, you can't let emotions change your gameplay during intense csgo matches. People get hyped of course, but after that round is over it's 100% focus again.\n\nBut then again, I'm no psychologist and this is just my 2 cents on the subject. I don't really look at all he do but I think it the opposite. He is very emotional but hide his emotions when they come up (with donation for example) I find him more \"honest\" than doc  He says he never leaves the house and is the laziest man on the planet.  You can tell by looking at him that he never gets any sunlight. He's very relatable to the average Reddit user. The point is that a piece of toast would have reacted more strongly than Shroud. Thank you for the great suggestion! Chaco is the most chill dude ever...  classy and humble. Thank you for taking the time, much appreciated feedback! Agreed. bigly my guy He uses a different camera angle now because he moved. I dont think I have seen shroud legitimately salty ever\n\nsometimes hes annoyed at himself because he missed a shot or something, but he is never straight up salty, blaming things [He looked older half a decade ago.](https://youtu.be/Iue6ijuB4d4) He\u2019s said the character is quite manufactured, he\u2019s adopted that sort of persona for gaming for a long time.  So true, I used to love his whole persona, but Doc 2.0 just doesn\u2019t feel the same. I can\u2019t really put my finger on what\u2019s different, but he just doesn\u2019t seem as good at the game anymore and spends way too much time making up shitty excuses about why. Um if you watched that solo win he had in fortnite with the snipe to end the game. He is still is the same lol. I think it's you that's changing. Agreed, I hope the video above didn't contribute to that, I intentionally made an effort to not favor one over the other, but let people compare their personalities for themselves. \n\nTl;dr: I hope the video above didn't contribute to that. Think he said he was the best PC player period if I'm not mistaken. GOD ACUILTE God trio of Aculite-Tomographic-Fugglet I love Aculite for his callouts. They\u2019re almost always on point.  In what way is Aculite better than Shroud? Or even Choco? [deleted] [deleted] Also kate>>>>disrespect You've given me a great idea, to have half the reactions be of positive things and the other half of negative things. I'll consider this for future use. Thanks! \"Wadu heck!\" - Wadu Heck Perhaps you misspelled \"hug.\" Would you like one? \ud83e\udd17\n\n---\nI'm a bot, and I like to give hugs. [source](https://github.com/as-com/reddit-hug-bot) | [contact](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=as-com) You must have excellent hearing if that bothers you.  Glad you enjoyed it!  Thank you WzDson! Doc said Shroud is better on stream lool nice try. Nobody cares Thank you Tanmay! \nThat's the plan, I hope to do more. When that happens, I'll upload it here. Appreciate the encouragement. If I remember they where real he said the day after.  They're really apples and oranges. Shroud is chill and skillful, Doc is exciting and plays with flair. I generally prefer a chiller stream, but I enjoy the because he is very explicitly playing a character rather than just being a \"ham it up\" streamer. Both styles are acceptable I watch both, more shroud though... Doc complains too much when he loses.  I watch both aswell. They compliment eachother well when duoing.  Thats exactly what it is... I feel ya, thank you! Dude.. do you not get the sarcasm? It\u2019s an alter ego. Hes supposed to be over the top self gratifying look at me douche bag. That\u2019s why it\u2019s entertaining. If you watch a few hours, you\u2019ll see the real guy poke through the Doc persona every now and again 1.) neither of them are kids. They\u2019re both adults. \n2.) this is their job. They\u2019ve made it their job. Respectively, they\u2019re both good at what they do. The money goes to them and their team if they have a team.. eg; marketing, IT guys, or in Doc\u2019s case, his production staff. \n\n\nShroud isn\u2019t a kid. Shroud is an ex-competitive/pro gamer who has won on the pro scene and built his following there. Doc is an alter ego he created when he left Sledgehammer Games (or was it Infinity Ward?). He saw an opportunity when Optic gaming was at its height on the CoD scene and went after them. (He was friends with those guys, it was for show). \n\n\nimo, they\u2019re no different than the actors/actresses who get paid to entertain on tv. Just this is the new medium where *you* can control who gets paid by donating directly to the entertainer. This is a much better format. Other than maybe 5 minutes if the super bowl, I can\u2019t even tell you the last time I watched cable or satellite or local over the air channels for that matter.  Its a show, he's acting like a macho Man from the 80s or 90s Keep trying to pull people down. Eventually you will have enough slack to hang yourself with it. What makes him a cunt? He's funny as hell. [Check out this clip.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrDisrespectLive/comments/86ceuc/doc_on_the_track/) If you didn't find this funny, then you are probably a chubby cheek, blonde bang pigeon toed NOBODY!\n\nGo ahead and watch Ninja all day as he destroys in Fortnite (exclusively) and does nothing else on his stream to entertain his audience. He has no arena, no black on black on slate black helicopter. No RoboDoc. No Turtle Beach lounge. And he can't dance for shit compared to the Doc.\n\nIn all seriousness, the Doc is like a WWE character that is like nothing else on Twitch. He's a trailblazer. You mean Ninja? So you hate movies because acting is fake aswell? Oh just don\u2019t watch it lol. Take a break from reddit It's a feedback nevertheless, thanks for taking the time! Sees making YouTube videos as worthwhile or streaming? You seem to be in the wrong place.  [removed] And where exactly was the fail part in this video? Appreciate the feedback! Helpful! This is like calling an actor a wanker for playing a certain character in a movie. It just makes you look dumb.  I think someone called Dr.Disrespect should be able to handle some disrespect tbh... Coz we dont want to understand that clown. Great insight. Maybe you can cure cancer for us next. I thought part of it was because the user name hairydix and amount $6969. Coincidentally, today Shroud tweeted a picture of a paypall refund request.\n\nNo idea from who though or how much.  Paypal don't refund Twitch donations/tips since 2016\n\n[Article](https://dotesports.com/the-op/news/paypal-twitch-chargebacks-3739#list-1)\n> \u201cAnd when selling with PayPal, merchants who meet the requirements are not liable if a buyer claims the purchase was an unauthorized transaction or they did not receive the item. Since customers are not purchasing something when they make a donation or tip, these transactions are not eligible for purchase protection and refund requests would be denied.\"  \n\nWhich leaves them to ask the bank for a refund, which you should probably be abit more careful with since it will look kinda suspicious of you to ask for refunds all the time I thought chargebacks were no longer possible for twitch because of all the trolls. I thought that the fear of a charge-back is a thing of the past. I recall someone saying that there's little chance for a donator to win against streamlabs or something. Ok, now I am not so confused about that. His reaction to the donation was weird to me and looked more like he was going, \"Why? Why the fuck would you waste that kind of money on me, of all people?\" Doubt it. Under doc's donation button it says that donos are non-refundable. I don't know how that works but I don't think shroud wouldn't use the same feature as well.  I hope he never changes it. I have no idea why it is what it is, but damned of that pigeon walking across the mattress makes me laugh.  So that\u2019s  what his donation sound is saying! I couldn\u2019t even understand it. It\u2019s just like sports fans. More people watch sports like football than play it themselves. You usually watch people better or more entertaining than you. And those donations are a lot of money for most of us, but it is usually a small amount for the donators.  I started watching while eating dinner or working on something. Then moved to watching to learn strategy etc. Now I'll periodically watch for entertainment.\n\nPlenty of people watch sports when they could be playing them. Watching the best people can be more entertaining than playing. To some people, throwing $10k at a streamer is like you throwing $5 at one.  Usually you wouldn\u2019t watch while you could be playing the game. Stream watching for me is something to have on in the background while doing work or maybe if I\u2019m eating by myself. The only streams I regularly would watch while I could be playing games are actual esports tournaments  You ever go out to an arcade to play games and watched the other kids before taking your turn? It's like that. Ive seen a few explinations from large doniations and youve just got the insanely wealthy that 5k is nothing to, or the moderately wealthy that went through some personal shit and always having that streamer available to watch gave them something to live for or just a distraction.  I'd read a while back that large donations are often/sometimes sponsors of that streamer. Might have just been bullshit theory, but I like it better than some one like me giving a months pay away. To be fair that clip was taken from the day he returned to streaming after the 'incident'. Well, when you have access to your parent\u2019s credit card, but then Dad finds out you dropped 5 large on a \u201cfookin\u201d video game... banks will be called.  Shroud is a great teacher. He breaks down the situation and explains why you should or shouldn\u2019t do something. I\u2019m always learning something new when he plays pubg.\n\nAnd well. Doc is just a online character (entertainment) which I do enjoy watching if lirik or shroud isn\u2019t on Shroud not complaining constantly about cheaters is also one of the reasons to watch him, because there are very few good pubg players who aren't so obnoxiously full of themselves that they call anyone who kills them a cheater. I'm looking at you, Viss. And both of them are all time best at each approach. Who knew something so fringe like streaming games on internet could one day become almost an art you have to be extremely good at to succeed. No streams are more entertaining than the Shroud & Chad duos. >  Doc's entertainment is that he is a very entertaining guy\n\nIf you are 12, yes. > Shroud's entertainment is that he is a VERY good player. \n\nIndeed!\n\n> Doc's entertainment is that he is a very entertaining guy and a pretty good player. \n\nNo he's a mediocre player and an unfunny hack. I think PUBG was right up Doc's alley and he was 99% as good as Shroud in that game.\n\nIn Fortnite, Shroud's still a killer but Doc isn't on that level. Fortnite's all about building and fast movement and creating cover for yourself at a moment's notice, Doc seems to still be in a PUBG mindset. Shroud and Ninja and KingRichard are playing a different game from the rest of the world, the way they build and out-maneuver people and throw down launchpads like they just willed it into existence. [deleted] agree, nothing can compare with tournaments, the adrenaline is like taking coke for the first time  Thats because its literally the only intresting part of his stream. It doesn't matter whether it's a persona or not. What he shows on stream is what's relevant to the viewer. If a viewer doesn't like his persona, he doesn't need to watch him based on the assumption that he might enjoy his actual personality, because he'll never get to see it.  When he cheated on his wife was that in character as well? For a lot of people it\u2019s for the same reason we watch pro sports  HAHA YES I TOO ENJOY FEELING THESE EMOTIONS AS A HUMAN Do both, promoting without the side effect of profit makes you look like the good guy, having it on YouTube instead of reddit only increases eyes on your work. Quality vid.  I was confused why this wasn't on YouTube.\n\nI just assumed you ripped it from a YouTube video. Link it here please. If that\u2019s against the rules pm me I really would like to sub. Fyi Reddit uploads are awful for me and I am more than happy to support a youtube channel (yours in this case) that produces good content! Cheers.  I can't get past the first 10 seconds with v reddit especially on mobile. Also no sound :( Not really. Works perfectly fine.  Doc doesn't like the desert map and isn't a fan of the slow midgame. Add in his constant complaints about the animations and \"unathletic\" controls and he'll play fortnite instead. Watching him play PUBG isn't fun anymore. All he seems to do is complain about it and rage quit to play Fortnite. Yesterday he played 2 games - in the second he dropped in the middle of nowhere, complained about not getting any loot, then challenged somebody near the apartments, whiffed 4 shotgun shots and blamed the game. Him playing PUBG brought me to Twitch but I can't watch him anymore. He actually uninstalled it on the stream yesterday after playing for like half an hour, so it's probably not coming back any time soon He uninstalled the game yesterday cause of hit reg problems (he was missing) and went to Fortnite. He played yesterday. He lost a few fights and immediately uninstalled  You are not missing anything honestly. The last 4 times I've seen him play PUBG its just been him complaining like the most annoying brat imaginable about literally everything and anything that happens to him. \n\nUsed to be a huge fan of him but the way he's been acting lately is just pushing me off more and more. And looking at his viewer count for the last weeks I'm not the only one who noticed his change. (His count passed from 40-50k to around 20k, that's a really big drop)\n\n This is true I'll donate a little here and there cause Shroud makes my younger brother happy and I appreciate that his videos are there for my Autistic younger brother (my little bro plays pubg with from time to time but he gets frustrated.) He'd rather watch me play but I have to work I can't be home all the time so Shroud does for me what I can't do to keep my brother entertained and I have to say I appreciate it. Sponsoring you get them to advertise you or your brand. In this case it only broadcasts your twitch name. [deleted] I\u2019m kind of with him though lol That's the minority. Paypal has protection against that shit.  Shroud loves fortnite. He just said it in his stream earlier. He loves it cause of how smooth the gameplay is, 240hz capped. Smooth as a butter, he said.  Did they really? > Lots of streamers have. It's sad how PUBG has fallen, especially with the recent publicity Drake has brought to Fortnite\n\nfallen? 2.5 million players in last 24 hours is a fallen to you?\n\nI hope you are just joking. And it\u2019s also part of hos charm. Fuck I don\u2019t wan to losten to ninja or anyone who overreacts to the point that I don\u2019t feel comfortable As I say, he's been playing competitive shooters for years. He still reacts but when you've been that good for a long time there's no need to get so hyped up on every good play because you do them all the time Yep. I used to watch him quite a lot and since he left and came back, I watched his stream once and didn't really enjoy.  You, don't need a tldr for one sentence lol Aculite is great, just so chill and smooth, bonus points for Ryan and Tom and then squads with Fugglet are just fun.\n\n\u201cBehind the wooden tree\u201c It\u2019s a hard choice since I found Fugglet first but Aculite seems to be better mechanically but Fugglet puts out some funny shit.  Personality mainly Totally, dude. I\u2019d recommend alternating between good and bad. Let me know when you post the next one! Congrats on finding out what sarcasm is mate\n\nthatsthejoke.jpg Neat.. I know it's these kids jobs and all. But I'm just thinking for someone who is a spectator to drop 5k on nothing important. You know? I wouldn't go watch someone play BF1 and be like.. wow you're good.  Here's $6969.  LOL get fucked. At least I'm not a doc fan. Funny? I think you mean annoying, shitty acted, fake bs.\n\n> Go ahead and watch Ninja all day as he destroys in Fortnite (exclusively) and does nothing else on his stream to entertain his audience\n\nThat is a much better thing yes, sadly Fortnite/PUBG aren't exactly entertaining games to watch being streamed, fun to play though.\n\n> He has no arena, no black on black on slate black helicopter. No RoboDoc. No Turtle Beach lounge. And he can't dance for shit compared to the Doc.\n\nALl the things you mentioned are completely worthless and uninteresting.\n\n> In all seriousness, the Doc is like a WWE character that is like nothing else on Twitch. He's a trailblazer.\n\nAll in all he's a fake hack that's unfunny and does things other people have done on-off for years. He's about as trailblazer as water. oh, cmon. streams its not movies. But doc just make his auditory becose he act and we dont know who he is irl. Maybe he good guy or maybe he asshole. And i dont like his alter-ego, he to loud for me. [removed] It's not a fail. /r/LivestreamFail is more of a twitch clip meta community, don't let the name confuse you He's a wanker for cheating on his wife. Great insight. Maybe you can stfu next.\n\nthe comparison of a extrovert character with a introvert that its only him no character or persona, its fucking retarded. If you watch his streams a lot, this \"hairydix\" character commonly donates stupid amounts of money. He once got into a fight with like three other people on who could donate the most, and he ended up \"winning\" at something like $1600.\n\nSoo..\n\nThere's that. > Which leaves them to ask the bank for a refund, which you should probably be abit more careful with since it will look kinda suspicious of you to ask for refunds all the time\n\nYeah man, exactly right. It's way better than it used to be, but for streamers like Shroud who get 1000+ subs a day it's still something he needs to be careful of. What if you withdraw the money to your bank account before the donor can do a chargeback? Still a massive risk. Obviously your bank is probably going to wise up if it's something that happens repeatedly, but I'm pretty sure these huge troll donations are likely done with stolen credit cards more often than not.  I recall that Shroud once said some of donators succesfully requested a refund.  what if it is a stolen card? Yeah Paypal no longer offers the chargebacks for donations, but people can still do it through their bank. It's nowhere near as prevalent as it used to be, definitely, but still an issue for huge streamers. It's definitely way less of an issue because Paypal no longer offers the chargebacks for donations, but people can still do it through their bank. Meaningless.  not sure if docs just lying about that since with paypal i believe its very easy to refund. theres no way for the streamer to prove the money is theirs and paypal just lets you charge it back no problem Yeah I always wondered. Some one enlighten me  I think the pigeon's walking across a sidewalk Shroud said in one of his past streams in the coming months he\u2019s doing a complete re-haul of his channel. So we will see what happens \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c How is this even remotely the same?\n\nI would never give Tom Brady 5k. These people do it to have their names show up on screen mostly.  You're probably right, there's correlation there cause I have absolutely no interest watching pro sports either. \nStill, really big amount or not, I just can't justify donating money to anyone who's just playing videogames.  That part I understand, but I wouldn't give them $5 either.  You do realize that adults with high paying jobs play video games right?  Not everyone that plays video games or watches twitch lives with mommy and daddy in their basement. If you like that about shroud, you should watch choco taco. Very laid back stream and he explains everything.  Hes a great mechanics teacher but he has no patience or even an interest in winning a game. All about fraggin' \n\n\n\nLove him all around solid guy Sacriel is also a very good player and teacher.  I've enjoyed his humor as well This is one of the massive reasons I enjoy watching him, he isn't just constantly complaining about either the game or cheaters. Seems better recently but id swear every time I tuned in when he was doing Squads one of the other guys would be complaining about something.  That's why I watch \"choco\" \n\nI can't think of a time where he got heated or aggressively upset because he died. I saw a duos match where he was playing with a guy with no mic, and the final 4 players where choco+fam and 2 people who were steadily dropping players with large headshots. Everyone in chat was saying that the 2 remaining enemies were wallhacking and choco didn't care, he tried to tactically approach the situation and force the cheaters to run through the blue, but RNG didn't favor them and the cheaters won. \n\nChoco didn't get upset, didn't report them, just said \"good game buddy\" to his teammate and moved to the next match\n\nProps to the mature streamers that can keep a fun game in perspective  It's weird, I feel like Viss never really complained about cheaters or snipers all that much and then all of a sudden he really started doing it. I still watch but I agree it's annoying. \n\nNot nearly as annoying as that one guy that was this sub's darling in the early days. I forget his name but his stream was absolutely unwatchable to me because ANY time he got killed, no matter what he called cheater.  To be fair, cheaters seem to have ramped up a lot in fpp the past couple weeks I'm so happy you mentioned Viss. I haven't see too much talk about him, but he has the most massive ego. And the way he speaks to his viewers is at times so condescending. His whole demeanor is so off-putting. Complaining about legitimate problems make you full of yourself? No wonder real life is so messed up lol. > full of himself\n\n> viss\n\npick 1 haHAA if you enjoy a streamer I don\u2019t you\u2019re 12 bye haHAA This guy probably doesn't think farts are funny either... A lot of people obviously disagree with you.  >I think PUBG was right up Doc's alley and he was 99% as good as Shroud in that game.\n\nAt least you got **was** right. He used to play CS:GO professionally. When your career hinges on being the world's top 1%, you get really good. It\u2019s almost as if he\u2019s been playing FPS games for a very long time + he also has a ton of stream snipers who give him free kills > proof\n\nI don't think this word means what you think it means. The dude has the exact same reaction speed, accuracy, and map/positioning knowledge in CS, where he played professionally for years in tournaments with monitored setups. The skills he's learned just translate very easily to other games.\n\nWhen you play a game for thousands of hours you just learn what people are most likely to do, where you should be monitoring, and what you need to do to mitigate risks. There's nothing dodgy about the way he plays. It's the result of not just playing, but literally TRAINING to play videogames, which he did every day for years.\n\nHe has played lots of games that are in alpha and beta - EFT, Darwin Project, Hunt: Showdown, Island of Nyne, etc. LONG before there were ever any cheats for them, and he destroyed just as much as any other game he plays. The dude is just very, very good. Those \u201cproof\u201d videos are so cringy. A lot people accuse him and the best proof anyone can come up with is weak at best. If he was actually cheating he\u2019d be exposed and there wouldn\u2019t just be flimsy conspiracy theories.  yikes This cannot be a serious comment... Right, ok so lets get into this.\n\n1.  He played CSGO professionally and did amazingly at LAN tournaments.  At these tournaments, the PCs are usually built or shipped in before the event.  Everything is provided and they can't use USB sticks or access these computers without a referee literally watching everything they're doing.  You cannot hack in big tournaments, it's not possible.  Shroud wasn't even the best there but he's still amazing at fragging, which he did in front of thousands of people and referees watching everything he did.\n\n2.  His skill is transferable.  He loads up new games, like darwin project; hunt showdown; fortnite, and you can see his ability shows through. Literally downloads a game, loads it up, and two games later after learning a bit more he gets a win.  Same with any game he plays, you can see the gaming ability in him.  It's like with any sportsman, my brother in law is a professional football (\"soccer\") player and you wouldn't believe just how amazing he is at literally every other sport as well.  It's the same with shroud.  When you have the ability, you can transfer it to other games.  If it's an FPS, simply by being shroud he will be in the top top top end because he has the reactions and he has the skill.\n\nAt this kind of level it feels like cheating because it's impossible for the average person to fully comprehend how good he is.  To put it like my brother in law did:  You're better than literally every other person who has been playing this game for their entire lives.  People who have been training day in, day out.  Dedicating themselves to the process, making it their career.  Literally people live off the skills they have as a career, and they still can't touch shroud.  That's how good you have to be as a pro player.\n\nTo put it yet another way, this is like you going down the courts and having lebron there in a pickup game.  This is like having messi or ronaldo coming to your 5v5 match.  Would you win in those situations??  No, but you call cheat on someone who's put work into video games and is literally up there.  Come on mate. \"\"\"\"proof\"\"\"\" Sure, he quit his professional CS:GO career to cheat against randoms in PUBG OMEGALUL Easy to get 30kill game when 15kill come by ppl who drives around him honking and screaming.\n\nHe is awesome player, but thats the reason he can get 30 kills in 1 game. I don't think anyone said that. It's just context. I would have doc if he was a legit guy who sincerely acted that way. But as a character he's entertaining. https://www.twitch.tv/videos/241575080?t=1h24m44s If they're two different people what is the problem. American beauty is a good movie. Kevin spaceys a creepy fuck.  I've never understood watching sports either. \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af Zuckerberg? I hope to never be a person that would do that. It's considered self-advertising to post youtube links and so I avoided doing that. [Link To The Video On My Youtube Ch.](https://youtu.be/6WDF-U0x6fE)\n\nI saw some people saying it wasn't playing well and if it did the audio was off. I tried it on my iphone 5 and it was true for me too. So at the risk of being labeled as as a self-advertising jackass, there is the YT link for those people.\n\nEdit: Thank Youuuu for the gold, It's a much needed & appreciated support!<3\nEdit: Grammar correction (Need -> Needed) I've had good experience with reddit video. But I believe you, thank you, thats means a great deal! Cheers! except it's slower, can't link directly to video, doesn't embed in fucking anything, can't download video and doesn't work on mobile 90% of the time. But yeah, it works perfectly fine sometimes so we should just keep using inferior shit. Nigga what? It's complete *garbage*. He'll play Fortnite because he can gather bigger audience and more donations, subscribers, etc with it than with PUBG. He talks about Fortnite being kids game with kids graphics etc but still plays it. He would play LoL if he wouldnt be more into FPS games. Hes straight up bad at fortnite though, especially when compared to other streamers. To be fair, loot in pubg has been absolutely terrible to the point where you can land alone and get pissed that you don't find anything of value in an entire set of apartment buildings before having to move.  At least fortnite can generally guarantee me a rifle and a shotgun and a small amount of meds, even if I don't find it literally immediately, and I don't feel horribly defenseless even if all I'm holding is a pistol when I land.\n\nPubg just leaves you feeling fucked over some games, frequently enough that it ruins the experience for quite a number of people.  I'd love to come back but I don't want to come back to a game that makes me feel like I wasted my time not having fun at all.  I can understand his frustration with the game to an extent because of that. That's also kind of his shtick though. Sort of memeing the average gamer where something is clearly their fault and they blame the game/lag He uninstalled it 6 or 7 times before. He'll be back next week. he uninstalls it like twice daily lol Yea he uninstalls games that make him angry on the regular. He\u2019s usually seen playing the game the next day. He uninstalled Fortnite the other day and I saw him playing it again the next morning. I get a ~170mb download speed on steam, 70mb on battle.net\nso he can play that game again in 2minutes if he wants, it's just for the entertainment to uninstall a game. Streamers are keen to do tricks like this to get more audience and \"aww\" moments from audience. It looks good on stream. Then they just silently move everything back from the trash bin.\n\nDon't get fooled. why do you say \"he actually uninstalled it on the stream yesterday\" like it matters?\n\nwith today's internet, not to mention the high-quality connection required to be a fulltime streamer, he can easily download pubg in under 5 minutes ^^wholesome That\u2019s a different type of sponsoring, the kind brands and companies do. We are talking about providing funds for a project or activity or the person carrying it out which is what sponsor means in this context.  Many people do both.  Why do people watch hockey, football, baseball, soccer everyday??? Why don't they just play it themselves?\n\nGet it now?  I don't watch streams, but I see the appeal to it. Shroud is a great player, and by watching him play, you can pick up on a lot of stuff you wouldn't normally think of yourself. You learn, you adapt, you get better. It's also entertaining to have something playing in the background as you play yourself. How so?  I\u2019m pretty sure we all wish epic made PUBG at this point.  The day EPIC gets of their high horse and introduces first person view is the day I permanently drop pubg. But seeing how EPIC is, that'll sadly probably never happen. They play both yea shroud just plays pubg at the beginning of his stream to catch his normal pubg viewers or pubg viewers in general until he gets a steady 30-40k then he switches to fortnite  Fortnite is dominating on twitch these days. The popularity is unmistakable.  It has fallen, look at the stats compared to 2 months ago. It's still one of the most played games on the planet, but if I had 3.25 million 2 months ago and 2.5 million now I'd be worried.  What were the stats pre-Fortnite BR though? average players has dropped the past two months.....so yea... it has fallen Yeah, I understand. I'm not saying that he or anyone else should react any certain way. Just know that some people find his blandness quite boring. He does. \n\ntldr; he does. I've played quite a bit of Argo with Aculite and he is so much fun when to play with or even against, as he'll sometimes just sit on all chat making his callouts and everyone on the enemy team is like \"is he talking about me?\" And then DINK you're dead.  I will (followed), thank you! Sorry... my friends call me captain literal. You and me both. Lol.. but when there\u2019s 30k+ watching you, there\u2019s bound to be some trust fund kids who have nothing better to do. \n\n\nI do have a tin foil hat theory tho.. I get a suspicious feeling that sometimes their sponsors drop the big \u201cdonations.\u201d But idk if that would make sense for either from a tax perspective on both sides. It could be legit donation or it could be time for a payment from a sponsor in the form of a donation to drive up donations. Not all big donations, just some..  [WRONG](https://i.imgur.com/N0htf0W.jpg) Oh, ok \n\nNvm me then Why don't I stream? ^^^^^Oh ^^^^^yeah, ^^^^^I'm ^^^^^bad. It's something to be afraid of for any streamer. I have had close friends with small streams happening that to them, it's devastating. Negative money lol The entity doing the chargeback--your bank, PayPal, credit card company--considers you as owing them that money since they've refunded it to whoever originally sent it.  So unless you never want to do business with them again and think having their legal dept. on your tail would be fun, you pay them. isn't that risky as fuck? trolling some streamer isn't worth getting my bank account cancelled. I'm pretty sure Paypal agreed not to chargeback Twitch donations because of all the trolls a few years back  \n\nEdit: Yep Donations/Tips are not refundable since 2016 [Source](https://dotesports.com/the-op/news/paypal-twitch-chargebacks-3739#list-2)  \n\n> \u201cAnd when selling with PayPal, merchants who meet the requirements are not liable if a buyer claims the purchase was an unauthorized transaction or they did not receive the item. Since customers are not purchasing something when they make a donation or tip, these transactions are not eligible for purchase protection and refund requests would be denied.\" It\u2019s from a CSGO custom map that shroud played, cant remember what it\u2019s called  https://youtu.be/Bq8c0CYJ94o?t=111 What if pro NFL players relied on sales of their specific jersey and donations during games instead of their current pay structure?  You don't have $20,000,000 to throw around. It would be similar to the Pats running a free open practice with the ability to communicate with the players. Paying $10 a month gets you access to talking to the bigger names on the team. Now you can pay an amount to say exactly what you want directly to Tom Brady and throw on an extra $4995 to see the shock factor.\n\nIt's a different stupid world. Just ask yourself, how much would people pay to have their messages show at the jumbotron at Madison Square Garden? If there was no or little filter, how stupid would these messages be?  That's just your choice man. Some people like to throw some change at an entertainer they enjoy.  That\u2019s fine. I simply offered a plausible reason for the chargeback.\n\nThe others being spouses, trolls, and oligarchs.  Choco is quality Justin is complaining constantly these days Holy shit, yes. I really enjoy just watching Shroud decimate people on PUBG, but oftentimes he has somebody with him who constantly keeps whining about getting killed. I remember one stream specifically where for like two hours, somebody he was streaming with (can't remember if it was chadd or just9n or whoever) kept complaining that \"this is why Fortnite is a better game this is why Fortnite is more successful this is why PUBG is a shitty game you just have so much downtime and then you get shot by some randomer ugh\", even when they weren't caught out in the open, but engaged in a firefight that lasted for a little while and then got killed.\n\nMeanwhile, Shroud reacted completely calmly and just agreed with something like \"Yeah, that's one annoying thing about it\" etc, while I was just thinking \"Go fucking play Fortnite and let Shroud play PUBG then, 'cause he's actually good at it\".\n\nLike, fair enough, I do not mind streamers reacting to getting killed or being upset at the game, but if you start whining about playing the game that you *chose* to play (with somebody more successful who's giving you more exposure and who most people came to watch, who concurrently isn't being whiny), then just fucking go play that other game. Undermining all the viewers who came to see either you - or the other streamer - play this specific game is just...shitty. It's not even about being triggered by a whiny tone or you being loud; it's just you making your viewers feel shitty for wanting to see you play some specific game.\n\ntl:dr; Yeah, I agree; Shroud being so calm is one of the major reasons he's my most consistently-watched stream.\n\nEDIT: \u201cmaking your viewers feel shitty\u201d, not \u201cmaking your streamers feel shitty\u201d. Derp. Also if he does encounter a cheater he doesn't freak out which is even more amazing. I watched choco play a game against an obvious hacker, it was with the \"tron\" guy, they made it to the top 2 and tried to nade spam them until eventually getting insta headshotted. Choco kept his cool the entire time, even though pretty much any other normal human on the planet would be just a little bit tilted getting robbed of a victory by someone hacking. Its just two different reactions to cheaters. \n\nIn CS if theres a cheater on the other team i just try to ignore it, theres nothing you can do so raging just puts everyone down. \n\nJust play as if they are amazing players and you have a chance to win. What?!? I haven\u2019t ran into a single one in over 2 weeks. 1000x better than it was.  I watch him quite a bit, and I don't get that feeling at all. Oh well. He can be whiny but this is absolutely not the case. I have never seen him be condescending to viewers. I call bullshit on that. Have you seen any of his videos on YT? He does shit an AI could barely do. He knows where players are even without seeing them, doesn't die when taking massive amounts of hits. He's definitely an amazing player, but there's a ton of suspect shit about his gameplay.  [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Nah, even that robot is more human than Zuckerberg. Don't see how it's different in any way to upload the same video to reddit. It's one video hoster vs another.  Reddit video never works for me, so thanks for the link!  [Link To The Video On My Youtube Ch.](https://youtu.be/6WDF-U0x6fE)\n\nclick at the risk of supporting self-advertisement :)\n He's all about getting kiddie money, that's why his persona is what it is  [deleted] Yeah he's not great but you gotta account for the fact that he hasn't been playing it as long as them. He's getting decent though. Straight up bad? I can't make that conclusion. He has great awareness and he's pretty good at shooting. He isn't great at the building yet. He's mentioned that it's a skill gap and it takes time to manage it and get better. Its why pro athletes are just going to better than most people in a sport they never played. They just have a higher floor in baser skills. \n\nThat said, I watch Doc because he's entertaining. He played World of tanks the other day and it was a fun stream because it was the doc. Despite never playing WoT he understood positioning and map awareness pretty well even though he didnt know how to switch between ammo types or zoom in to shoot more accurately which are skills you gain over time.   But the loot RNG has always been a feature of PUBG. If you're expecting a good efficient loot haul from apartments you're gonna have a bad time! That is one of th reasons players always drop at the same location over and over again. Cause the loot is terrible anywhere outside those locations (pecado, military island, etc). \n\nIf we had an incentive  to drop in different locations...but nope.  Fair point, though I took it that he was exasperated with the state of the game currently and wanted to publicly show his audience. Especially when minutes before he called it the most overrated game of all time.  5 mins is a tad optimistic That's just donating lmao [deleted] [deleted] Ugh can you imagine? With Paragon level graphics....  Fortnite has years of developement behind it. AND it's made on epic's own engine. PUBG is all new. Just give it some time. It sure isn't smooth but you can't expect a two year old game to be better than PUBG is rigth now. No, I just wish PUBG was also in development for 7 years I'm pretty sure I don't want jetpacks in pubg. I wish ANYONE else made pubg other than bluehole at this point Nah doc said today on stream he\u2019s done with pubg unfortunately Just like how PUBG was dominating, and Overwatch was dominating before that.\n\nGames come and go. Fortnite is just the fresh new game atm So because fortnite has few more viewers because it's more fresh game and also free to play so streamers can swap any time, just because of that it means that pubg already died?\n\nfuck logic.\n\nit reminds me of CS:GO haters, because CS:GO is dying since 2014 and looks like they are getting better and better. 3.25 million was a 1 time peak, the only change is now is 5% less players than in last month but game didn't fall.\n\nYou can say \"pubg has fallen\" if there would be... let's say 50% drop or 90-100% drop (no man sky flashbacks).  People dont stay at the same interest level for games they play rofl  > What were the stats pre-Fortnite BR though?\n\npre-fortnite\n\nAugust 2017 +69.58%\t874,171 (highest peak players)\n\nSeptember 2017 +69.49%\t1,550,463 (highest peak players)\n\nafter fortnite:\n\nOctober 2017 +64.59%\t2,390,946  (highest peak players)\n\nNovember 2017\t+22.78%\t2,915,723  (highest peak players)\n\nDecember 2017\t+7.64%\t3,080,769  (highest peak players)\n\nJanuary 2018 +10.36%\t3,236,027  (highest peak players)\n\n**As you can see, totally no influence from fortnite on pubg.**\n\nPS: That was a good question and most likely you are the first person that asked it.\n And just know that people find the over the top cockiness to be super douchey and very offputting.  Ok Your tl;dr is too long.\n\ntl;dr: too long. Picked by shitty kids yes well done. Yup, the name is a bit confusing but the sub describes itself as this: /r/LivestreamFail: For Your Win or Fail Livestream Moments\n\nHalf of the clips featured in the video have probably been posted individually already but I bet the user base would like to see the juxtaposition.  I probably should've explained it better in my post but I was honestly trying to give the guy a tip on how to get more views The better question is: What the fuck does HairyDix do that he can afford all these donations? I want HairyDix's job. he's got the *big* bucks! It doesn't even matter. Doc isn't good and he still rolls in the money. Hell, the guy who was previously rank 1 kill rating for squad fpp streams. I looked him up because his icon is Twitch. 0 viewers. I myself was top 5 and no viewers. It doesn't matter. Yup sure is. Unfortunately, a lot of people are really fucking stupid and will happily put themselves out for a troll. People have definitely done dumber things. Dont wowrk like that. Used to run a business where I had 100+ of these refund claims, lost maybe 30% or more. They claim fraud, someone else used the card, and so forth. And bank policy is that customer is ALWAYS right, so usually they win the claim. \n\nThe thing is, you can never know if its legit or not, a kid can use his mothers card and so on. And as long as you havent done it already at the same account, they win 90%+ of the times. Sometimes paypal actually payed both me and the buyer tho, rare occations tho. they do chargeback its just done like this. scumback donate and claim his account was hacked. when scumback did the donation he  was logged into paypal thru a vpn.\n\nStill work like a charm to this day cuz visa, mastercards, banks etc has to reimbruce customers in most western countries.\n\na paypal tos is meaningless in most countries if you didnt know as local and from where im from european law trumps paypal in every aspect.\n\nSource: I manage a 2 danish streamers + ive won a case against paypal in danish court. I think its the one where they jump on chairs and kill a dragon? Something like that \n\n[Found it!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8c0CYJ94o) its at 0:18 I'm fairly certain the sound does not originate from that map, as i believe i've heard that before and i wasnt even aware of the CSGO map. Where is the pigeon though? Watched for like 5 minutes from your timestamp. I don't watch these streams though. But i've seen clips and I wouldn't put too much into the word \"communicate\". It would be like me throwing tom brady 100 bucks and him saying, Thanks Kcsgayy and walking away. If people enjoy that, all the power to them. I just find it a strange way to waste money.  fair enough.  Probably over reacted, it was just literally the third post I had seen that was similar to yours in several different threads. Check in on one of his duo streams with choco. He seems much more relaxed when paired with him. It might sound a little silly and specific, but some streamers are actually fine as long as you can't hear their closed mic. I think Chadd is a great addition to Shroud's stream, but if you've ever watched Chadd's stream, all he does is call people who criticize him retards and threaten to remove his mods' mod status if they don't start banning people and clearing the chat faster. Just a total autist on his own stream, but fine when he's PTTing from Shroud's PoV. I've noticed the same thing with some of the people Choco play with.  Death, Taxes, and J9 complaining Just watching a Shroud video, so much Justin complaining in there... Paha.  Id love to see StoneMountain and Shroud in duo actually. even more so id love to see Stone do a YOLO with Shroud in his squad... \n\nI rarely catch him live but like his streams too because of a lack of complaining.  With good reason, this game is broken as hell Definitely wasn't j9 lol he hates fortnite I don't even fucking get how can they say fortnite is better than pubg especially when u play FPS PUBG and Fortnite is TPS. Yeah, maybe server sare more stable in fortnite but gameplay totaly different. It's like playing CoD and keep saying how BF is better.  I've had four in the past week. Still far less than tpp but I used to see none at all. I'm talking blatant 900 adr dudes too. Could be bad luck running into them Well, first of all, he's trying to look so much better than he is. I don't watch a lot of \"pro\" players, but the ones I do watch all play 1-man squads, 2-man squads, etc. Except for Viss. He doesn't challenge himself at all. And he almost always has some sort of excuse for why he died. Sometimes he calls cheater, but not a lot. Mostly it's because he expects the opponent to play \"better\" but because the opponent chose the \"weaker\" play, the opponent gets the advantage on Viss. It's always like \"Why would he still be in the house?\" \"Why would he go back towards X?\" etc. You\u2019re delusional man. Get this shit out of your head. Just look at all other movements he makes in the game. All perfect. He has absolutely mastered all these mechanics necessary for the game, part of the being awareness and spatial recognition.  Shroud plays Pubg for 8-10 hours every single day. He uploads at most 20 minutes of that. Mostly it's just compilations, sometimes full games.\n\nIf you go with 8 hours, and an average match taking 15 minutes (that's a high number) you still have at least 32 games  a day. Maybe one or two make it partly into his compilations.\n\nAs others have said he dies a lot in stupid ways, like we normal people do, too.\n\nAnd what do you mean he knows where people are behind walls an stuff? The guy is playing on max volume on headphones, he hears every fart.  [deleted] You realize he can hear them, right? Footsteps are loud as fuck in this game.  Can you read? At the start of the video it says shroud is clearly not cheating lmao. And by the stream sniper comment I mean that\u2019s why he gets 30 kill games  Dude they banned the Doc for team killing before. You think they wouldn\u2019t ban Shroud if he was hacking? Get real.  They can't because there's nothing to expose [deleted] It's skills. Shroud is an ex-pro CS:GO player and his accuracy has always been insane I feel kinda bad that you live in a world where people aren't capable of greatness. \n\nDid you call hacks when Bolt ran the 100 in 9.58? Or did you acknowledge that a genetic outlier combined with a lifetime of training could achieve the improbable? Why couldn't Shroud simply be this damn good, just because *you* can't conceive of it?  Timestamp for any of these accusations? I\u2019ve yet to see someone show a video of actual \u201cblatant\u201d hacking from Shroud. There are always claims of how obvious it is, but what they describe is never actually in a clip of his.  This is the kind of people that believe Elvis is still alive or worst, he is with the aliens. Why are you so stupid :( I feel bad for you In all of those clips he misses a bunch of shots. Like, it's insane, but if he were hacking he wouldn't miss a headshot by kar98 from someone in a dacia driving at him 20 metres away. Unless you're going to say that he turns his aimbot off, shoots two critical shots, then turns it on after he misses and headshots, which is like ............ Go watch some CS dude.  This shit isn't hacks, it's the result of thousands of hours of practice in the most competitive shooters in the world.. That video is skill and not blatant hacking It's not that different, the thing is, people naturally start to doubt your motivation/intention when linking to a source from which you make money. In my case, my channel is not even monetizable atm, didn't want my intentions to be doubted despite. I've gotten what I wanted, whether people would enjoy this type of a content or not and I've gotten my answer. I'm sorry for the long text.\n\nTl;dr: People doubt your intentions when linking to youtube. I bet you started watching doc one week ago.. You can have RNG loot without making it feel terrible, it's not a difficult concept.  I'm not asking that everyone gets exactly what they want, I'm asking that weapons are common enough that a player doesn't feel like they completely got screwed in the early game.  There's weapon attachments, armor upgrades, and high end meds and equipment that are perfectly fine being rare and completely RNG.  I don't feel fucked over if I don't have full level 3 or even level 2 gear, I don't feel fucked over if my attachment slots aren't full or I don't have the exact gun I want, I don't feel fucked over if I don't have a kar98k.  I feel fucked over when I don't even have a rifle.  The game pretty much revolves around engagements with a rifle.  If you don't have one, you're at a massive disadvantage.  If you land in an area that has a large number of locations for loot to be yet you can't find the one thing you need in the game to have a decently fair shot at winning without being a god at the game, it feels terrible and takes you out of the fun you should be having.\n\nIn other words, nobody gives a shit about clothing on the ground in a battle royale game, playing dress up doesn't mean anything when it'll be gone in 20 minutes. I have a 250/250 fiber optic connection, download speed on steam usually peaks around 35-40 Mb/s, so it really isn't that uncommon to have such low download times. When you sponsor a starving kid in Africa, its not so he can carry a sign of your local business. It's so they can grow and succeed.\nsponsoring doesn't always have to relate to marketing. It\u2019s not hard to see why people enjoy it. It\u2019s no different than watching a sporting event on TV. One may like to play basketball, ergo it\u2019s natural to assume they might find the best basketball players in the world entertaining. Even though they can go out and play a game themselves, it\u2019s entertaining to see the best of the best at a skill level one could never achieve. Donating to a streamer is akin to paying a few bucks for the sports package from your cable provider. If you really don\u2019t realize what\u2019s enjoyable about it, you\u2019ve fallen way behind the times. It\u2019s a very old concept that you\u2019re having a hard time applying to modern entertainment.  You know a PUBG match only last like 20-30 minutes right?\n\nAnd that people don't marathon game for hours on end every day? for point 2, they best way to see why others watch it is to compare it to something you watch. What stuff interest you and why? \n\n\nThe obvious example brought up a lot is watching a sport like ping pong or soccer. Why watch something you can play? Chess same thing. \n\n\nWhat about talk shows? why do people watch those when you can be talking to someone yourself?\n\n\nThe same reason people watch that stuff is similar to the reasons they watch people play sports.\n\n1. Maybe they don't have the ability to (physically, mentally, financially, lack of people ect.)\n2. They like the person/personality. Doc literally is putting on a live show, thats why he acts over the top and has stuff like green screen events. Same reason people watch SNL or scarily follow their favorite celebrity\n3. Skill, you want to see the top performers in action, whether its a perfect toss down field for the point or amazing flicks. This is why a lot of people watch shroud or CS GO/LoL tournamants\n\nAnd more ultimately it is person dependent, there are so many more reasons then any one can list. So if you don't enjoy it that is fine. But when you say \"I have yet to realize what is enjoyable about 2\" it shows that you did not think a lot on this or you think it is somehow not something people should be watching  and that those who do have something wrong with them. You most likely don't think this but that is how people feel with that wording. So do you truly not understand or do you not even want to understand?\n\n\nAs for chat streams, when you get big it becomes impossible to truly moderate so it becomes the lowest common denominator, which is what you see unfortunately. At this point its more like a stadium full of excited people instead of a few people in a room watching it on TV and having a conversation. \n\n\nGo to a smaller twitch channel, with someone who actually interacts with their viewers, and you will more likely get adult conversations. This is where your prejudice is coming into play. I am a normal adult. I work in the medical field. Home health care aid. I have minimal paperwork and realistically have to be there because the people I take care of are normal people but have a muscle problem or down syndrome. There is a lot of down time. I have a gaming laptop and play at work. Watch streams. Etc. To think adults aren't mature because the are involved in video games, tells me you have more maturing to do. Different strokes for different folks.  I\u2019ll take paragon level FPS.  I feel like you're looking at it all wrong. From a consumer point of view it shouldn't matter how long a game has been in development. PUBG is a fully released game and as a consumer you should expect a released game to be in a finished and optimized state.  >Nah doc said today on stream he\u2019s done with pubg unfortunately\n  \nlol do you have any idea how many times he's said that about the games he plays? He'll be back on PUBG when they release some content to bring him back. so how many times he was done with pubg already? Oh wow really, he was playing pubg within the last two weeks\n > Overwatch\n\nWas Overwatch ever dominating? I didn't play the game until season 3 so I didn't pay attention to the streams either.\n\n Lmao overwatch never dominated cs is kinda different. esports side grows and grows, and it is amazing to watch, really.\n\nCS itself and the awful state matchmaking is in right now? Couldnt be bothered to play this game, as long as valve doesnt give a shit about their normal playerbase. And i played 5k hours of cs and once loved that game, but nowadays there are so many broken things (gameplay itself is good, but cheaters, boosting services, smurfs.. they have to combat all these idiots trying to manipulate the system) That 5% drop last month is part of a 17% drop since 2 months ago. I feel like they could easily recoup that number by being more interactive with their community.  No shit, but the average player count is down almost 20% from 2 months ago, Fortnite and the couple of other BRs that have came out recently are definitely pulling players away from PUBG.  Yeah, i don't watch doc because of this. I can't really stand someone yelling into the camera after every move. Shroud is more my speed. Calm and collect. Chocotaco is the same way.   Plot twist: It's Jeff Bezos  He's not great; but he's still an above average player. Not pro level like Shroud, but still far more decent than the common player.\n\nI do agree, though, that skill does not matter to get a following. Doc's fun to watch (at least IMO and obviously to those of his followers), even when he fails. Sometimes, especially when he fails. And, like I said, he's pretty decent at the game still. There are other streamers that are *ridiculously* popular and yet completely suck-ass at the games they are playing. But they are fun to watch. At least to those who think so. You're coming off as salty... When doc played consistently he was pretty damn good. Not the best at the game but wayyy above the average player... I'd be willing to bet you have zero viewers because you have a boring personality.  Well, it have drastically reduced the twitch donator trolls anyways  \n\nIf you do this you're just not a troll, you're a scammer.. You can start videos at a specific time if you add #t=18s to your youtubelink (in this case for 18 seconds in) :-) Where is the pigeon though? Watched for like 5 minutes from your timestamp. What am I supposed to be looking at? Him shifting in his chair? It originates from that map, and it's now used fairly commonly in a lot of places. Not sure where he got the pigeon idea, the point was that\u2019s just where he got the sound effect for it I agree, and I probably should have said so in my original post, it's ridiculous to me that people would do that but I'm not a person in that situation so it's difficult to say what's normal for people with that amount of money. Ack, my bad, I didn\u2019t see anything similar, and I barely watch those guys. I didn\u2019t even know that it was a thing trolls were doing to streamers.  TIL.  They seem to gel pretty well too. Love this duo that doesn't surprise me at all.  Yeah Justin is fairly insufferable. I can't really watch Shroud's streams when he's on. Nothing against HIM, but the voice + complaining I just can't handle! Everyone that kills him = pleb I want StoneMountain, Shroud, Aculite and Tomographic. Would be the most chill stream ever. Yup, FPP  is now almost as plagued as TPP, almost. The thing is the higher you mmr is, the more you encounter them. Backing out of games when it's not the map I want to play in has affected my rank quite a bit but It's a lot more enjoyable now. There's still major D-Sync issues where people shoot you through the wall and I'd rather think it's the game rather than cheaters. That's what we call the Phil Hellmuth. I see what you're saying.\n\nHowever, he's been playing 1 man squad for the last 2-3 weeks now, and has been cleaning up.\n\nI don't see him call cheater very often, but he does do what you're saying and question why the enemy chose the weaker play. In the grand scheme of complaints though, that's really not that bad. I feel like it's his way of saying he got outplayed.\n\nIDK, different strokes for different folks. I just haven't gotten the same impression of him that you have, I guess. One of his earlier points is 30 kill game being impossible, I\u2019ve had games where I get 20 ish kills easy when shroud literally has people running at him stream sniping getting 30 is nothing lol. Shrouds insane at pubg and I highly doubt he cheats, his aim doesn\u2019t snap and how could he see through walls if we don\u2019t see it on stream? Definitely agree he\u2019s legit. Just a side note, it's not impossible to hack at pro tournaments. [deleted] Hell they banned shroud for teaming with Banana man... Proven in LAN, no doubt about it [deleted] [deleted] Fuck rifles, ive dropped hacienda,george and school recently and been running around half the map and still havent found an SMG.\n\nI think rifle spawns are ok but i really wish they'd up the SMG spawns so i at least feel i have a chance. I have fun changing my strategy when I have just a SMG or shotgun.  You definitely have to play differently, but I find it refreshing rather than everyone having rifles.  You have to control the engagements and use utility, a skill important to any high level play.  I've taken out many riflers with shotguns and SMGs by disengaging and reenganging, even when the initial fight is in a field with trees.\n\nI understand not everyone feels this way, of course. 35 Mb/s (or 4 MB/s) isn't that much for Steam though, something's up with your connection if that's all you're getting. im jealous That's also donating... And \"paragon level\" cosmetics too.\n\nIt just surprises me how much this bungled this game. Like sure they're making a lot of money. But can you imagine how much more dough they would be raking in if they had a decent art director and 3D art team?\n\nLooking through the crates on the test server it's just pathetic. Who is going to pay money for a turtle-neck tank top? Had they released decent weapon skins and actually well designed gear I could see them just crushing it in microtransaction sales.\n\n Sure you can expect it. I didn't say anything about that. And maybe the game shouldn't be out right now. (I do personally think it deserves to be out right now because it's in a good state but I'm not going to defend this point)\n\n All I'm saying is: if epic games were the ones developing this game it wouldn't change a damn thing. After 2 years of development fortnite wasn't in a great state either. \n\nI feel the circlejerk about Epic Games has no place here when the 2 games have so much difference in development time. You cannot expect PUBG to run as smooth as fortnite. You just can't. Remember when this sub flipped the fuck out about a limited time crate microtransaction during early access?\n\nFortnite is nothing but microtransactions in early access and everyone is fine with it.  I don\u2019t know if you have eye problems or not but I literally answered the other guy saying the same exact thing as you. I have no idea, I don\u2019t watch streamers like that he just so happened to say it when I was watching what fortnite was about.  No idea to be honest I don\u2019t really watch any streamer like that. I just so happened to be watching him play fortnite today because I wanted to see what it was about and I usually liked him when he played pubg so I figured he\u2019d be cool to watch for fortnite. \n\nStill didn\u2019t get me into fortnite tho just not the game for me.  Yeah he said something along the lines of pubg being to laggy and not smooth while fortnite runs super smooth.\n\nI can\u2019t get past the graphics and the building while fighting it\u2019s just not a skill I care to pick up.\n\nDrake boosted fortnite a crazy amount and is super popular on twitch now. Hopefully it calms down and pubg comes out with some good updates to start slowly winning back players. Overwatch has never been \"dominating\" in twitch aside from the first few weeks. The viewing experience is horrible. OWL has made some significant improvements that help so every time that is on Overwatch has decent views but otherwise not dominating at all. 1. pubg esports side doesn't grow?? let me answer instantly it does aswell.\n\n2.What things are broken in csgo?\n\nalso cheaters, boosting services, smurfs were always in cs:go! It happens in all games but cs:go have really great protection against that, trust factor is working fine, since trust factor went live all my games were only better.\n\nI'm not saying game is perfect and there is no cons because \"hey we fucked up but here take this gloves\" is annoying but it's the most polished game of all time. I have 2000 hours in CS:GO matchmaking and have seen like 4 cheaters total. i don't think so, a lot of people bought this game during \"amazing\" steam ads on steam on 1.0 release so they played for 2 months and they are bored.\n\n...but that's just my guess, no facts in this comment. I love me some Choco. Great at the game and appears super humble about it too.  I probably have 0 viewers because I'm streaming a game with thousands of other people and just started. Likely the same for the guy who was rank 1. The point I was making to the other guy was that skill doesn't matter when it comes to streaming. It's all about connections and building up a community. I'm not sure how that comes off as salty, it's just reality. Savage. 100% mate. Its scummy and i hope those trolls gets caught because it will indeed give jailtime if they push the limits. or you can click the share button and tick the box to automatically timestamp it for you :D Pair anyone with choco and you'd probably love 'em. Literally! https://youtu.be/7Jq4ce5MWrI?t=2m24s This is a good example of what is just like.. URGH STFU about Justin. But I do love Shroud's expression.  WackyJacky, Aculite, Fugglet, Shroud - I'd love to see this stream.\n\nThe knowledge, the voice, the greedy one and the aim wizard! Throw Spreeezy in there and baby we've got a stew goin'. That is actually a perfect comparison. His way of saying he got outplayed is exactly what makes him a douche. He can't ever actually admit he got outplayed because of his massive fucking ego, that's the entire point of my argument. It's very easy to not have wall hacks showing up on your stream while it does on your screen. A lot of funny videos where streamers mistakenly shows it to their viewers while not realising. \nWH is also not the most common way to cheat, there is one where you can get every players location on a different screen, think it's called ESP.\n\nShroud is not using it though, he dies a lot on his streams by people suddenly appearing behind him or from hiding behind corners etc.  Oh it\u2019s very possible to hack at pro tournaments and people have done it and people are probably doing it\n show me one instance of him knowing where someone is without seeing them at 300m away. Spoiler: you can't. Give it up dude. He used to play professional CS, on LAN where it's impossible to cheat and was one of the top players for a long time. Thats why his aim is so good. He knows where lots of the players are with audio. I can hear them in the video as well. I use a nice pair of headphones (senhieser hd598c + fiio ek10 dac/amp) and i can hear people from 3-4 houses over. And once you train your eyes enough spotting people gets very easy. Watch somebody like Aculite on YouTube as an example, the man has hawkeyes. If people can spot enemies from 1000m+ away, it should be easy for them to see them at 250/300m. There is absolutely no proof shroud is cheating so stop trying to save your argument. He was a pro csgo player for years, including >40 LAN tournaments. Dude isn't cheating he's just fuckin good.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjUbsVRe_Z4 that's at LAN in the semifinals of a $500k event. boi ain't cheating he's skilled as fuck > recorded obviously hacking in tons of videos\n\nOMEGALUL I sympathize with this sentiment. Reddit has a self promotion policy, if an account spends over 10% of its posts/comments on \"promoting\" stuff outside reddit mods can ban you.  That was supposed to be a big B. Maybe I am mixing MB and Mb, but what I was trying to say is it only takes few minutes for me aswell to download PUBG with the connection I have. Hi jealous, I'm dad! I bought a black turtle neck shirt.  I don't know where this is coming from. But Fortnite is free to play, and they still need to make money. Whereas pubg is pay to play. And on top of that Brendon green actually promised there would be NO microtransactions before release. The fan outrage is justified IMO Same here but i like to watch fortnite highlights. He's mediocre as a Fortnite player. You need to see other streamers if you want to see good plays in Fortnite. The thing is I don't think pubg will ever reclaim the br throne cuz it's not free to play i have 3600 hours on my main, and just checked my ban checker plugin for chrome. Didnt play a single game without cheaters in october, and i basically quit the game in november :D (playing a game or 2 every now and then but since november i am nowhere near the playtime that i had before) You have to have a marketable skill and build an audience. You're not going to have 5000 people randomly click your stream that's 500 channels down because your title is I'm #5 guyssssss.\n\nBeing good is a marketable skill, so is being entertaining. If you have neither, you won't get popular. There's no chance. There's no reason to watch you.\n\nIf you're actually good, and not just cheesing \"#5\" with some incredibly specific niche stat that nobody cares about, you DO have a chance of getting an audience. There's a reason to watch you. At that point it's whether or not you put in the effort to get noticed, as well as a bit of luck.\n\nBeing good certainly matters, it's going to be almost impossible to succeed if you suck, just like your average Joe dad isn't going to get paid for being a subpar footballer, even though he's like, really, really into it. or you can right click the video itself and click \"copy video URL at current time\" This is very true. I was impartial to J9 but now I actually pull up his stream. We could all use a friendly influence like Choco. He admits he got outplayed about as often as the Doc does. What are your thoughts on him? He also streams like 24/7 a d.never been \"caught\" that's proof enough. Innocent until proven guilty my friend  Its very hard and right now no one (In CSGO) is being suspected of cheating whoever made this bot, i love you A tactle neck. I\u2019ve watched a little ninja too he\u2019s crazy good. I just absolutely hate his personality tho which is why I tried doc.  Not just that though the game feels very very unpolished when compared to Fortnite. Very true. It\u2019s only 30 bucks tho so I could see them still being able to gain some more steam if they fixed some of the many bugs and added more content. \n\nIf they were smart they would drop a huge update and make the game free at the same time. soooo many people would try it out and the player base would grow.   See, you say that yet we had that guy who was shown on here a few days ago teaming in solos while streaming. The guy absolutely sucked, barely could 2v1 a random player, and yet this guy actually had over 150 viewers and dozens of subs/donations presumably for the day. If skill had anything to do with it, I'm positive this guy would be very alone on his stream. Honestly I don't even know how the guy got as big as he did considering he immediately started calling the solo guy a \"f@6607\" live on stream. But it is what it is  Someting i rly wish twitch has... Or you can link the video normally and put tell the time separately The Doc is a character, not a real person. That depends on who you ask. While hard not impossible  Laaaaaanaaaaaa\n Shroud is getting better and better everyday. He was just good three weeks ago but now he's a scary dude, he may be as good as Ninja with time. Give him a try, he's chill as always but playing Fortnite. If they cartooned the fuck out the game like Fortnite I'm sure it would play silky smooth. A lot of people play fortnite as an off game. He could already have a following from a different game, where the skills dont overlap. They could've had a following from a different site, like a YouTuber. \n\nMaybe someone just hosted him. But that doesn't mean he gets those viewers all the time \n\n\nHell, ive seen a kid stream old-school RuneScape but he had like 400 viewers. He never said anything, never acknowledged the chat that was freaking out at this random streamer. His stream only blew up that day by word of mouth. Every other day before and after he had 0 or 1 viewer.\n\nAll he was doing was fishing on 6 accounts, and wood cutting on 3, or something to that extent. Completely disengaged. Chat was at the point they were convinced he was mute or being held hostage as a gold farmer. They even tried to get him to blink purposefully for responses.\n\nWeird shit can happen, man. for vods, it does. Click the cog True, but I feel Doc is such a convincing character because his reactions are in line with how Guy would be reacting anyway. Those aren't fake reactions for the character, imo. Its nearly impossible on a tournament stage. If you ask some gold nova players if they think someone is cheating as pro then obviously theyre gonna say yes I don't think it would tbh.  oh when they add this? wtf b4 they did no have but I have not watching vod many times for a long times The Doc is over-the-top, selfish, full of himself, and a braggart because it's funny. The Doc is an act, Viss isn't. It has happened you know Thorin? Is a gold nova TIL  Idk when it was added but it\u2019s there Nah, he gets mad for real, its not an act It has, only a few times. And only one or twice on a stage Lmao he is actually a gold nova, but Thorin is an exception to the case given his knowledge and experience with the scene. When did he accuse someone of cheating recently though? Can I get a source"}], [{"author": "Maderoh", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/86x35u/what_about_music_when_you_win_a_match/", "id": "86x35u", "selftext": "I know that isn't important, but it would be nice to win a match and hear something like at least FX.

Quality shitpost The first post was a legitimate feature reqest and now it's been recycled, reused and pooped out as a meme. Really?  Is this poking fun at the 4x scope with the red dot on it?\n\nIf it's in good humor I'm with it, but if it's mocking the idea the humor is lost for me.\n\nThat's a commonly used IRL set up for obvious reasons. Why wouldn't they want to add that? This isn't too bad of an idea - but this still doesn't solve the slow mid-game.  No. The other one really made sense now you are just being silly Nah man just up the rof to vector speed and the recoil of a M4 and we gucci top notch meme XD [deleted] Drunk you are how? This. People acting like right clicking on an item in the inventory is hard work. It'd be nice for attachments to juto auto attach when swapping weapons that are in the same class. haha  Put a kar98 onto your kar98 onto your kar98 onto your kar98...\n\nSo you have no need to bolt! ... or they could fix the bug that causes the bullets to appear behind the bolt, but that's asking a bit much from a small dev team. Right there with you, man.  [\u201cThanks for the spot, I just unlocked the bipod for my bipod\u201d](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HzajrKmMoxo)  Attachment memes Someone should put together what a automatic silenced kar98 would sound like.  Here is the fully automatic Lee Enfield [attachment](http://www.forgottenweapons.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/PB937-1.jpg)\n\nIt can be done if all you got is bolt actions, but your army needs machine guns. message Weiqunshun, he'll fix you a solution Tactical AF Like five or six right now, my dude.  Needs more scopes Pistols do not have Scopes and bipods, not enough for me Jar98k My lord, is that legal? Attach an AWM onto the muzzle of your m24 for less bullet drop. Or just attach the car to the gun \ud83d\udc4d It's also a gun RWBY Cosmetic Crate coming soon. \ud83d\udc4d Its a parody on this post : https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/8b77y6/what_about_rco_scopes_in_pubg/\n\n:) Obviously the kar-16 will share bullet's if used in assault or sniper rifle mode Because it was a shitty request. Might as well show you the distance of your opponent as well to make it more comfortable to rangefinde. Also make it so your weapon shoots automatically when above an enemy head so you won't have to manually left click. Yes it's in good humor. The opportunity for a bit of hyperbole was too good to pass up. Its quite easy to swap out your scopes, so adding any type of ROC seemed amusing to me. I think it would be a good addition to the game however as a separate scope. ie 4x, 8x, 15x, ROC4x, ROC8x, ROC15x. sorta like an improved class of scopes. > Why wouldn't they want to add that? \n\nBecause it's obscenely overpowered.\n\nWhy oh why do people keep going back to the \"but in real life...\" thing PUBG? This is a *game*. Balance and gameplay is a lot more important than realism. It's why you can get shot 8 times, jab yourself with a syringe and then pound a couple redbulls before you sprint at a superhuman pace across uneven terrain without ever resting whilst carrying 130 pounds. Im sure the devs could make it work. I have encountered zero issues with switching sights in the game. Takes a second or less for anyone familiar with the UI. Yeah that would be great! Attached meme Most definitely  You are like a little baby. Watch this. Still trying to unlock the bipod for my combat knife. I will make it legal. The first request was an RCO. Either way I'm down for it. \n\nThose that say it isn't a big deal, are probably those who don't change many of the basic key bindings for quick and smooth access like myself and other will often do. Attach meme SUCC^C^C^C [deleted] Dew it! I know. I'm saying it would make the game easier but more comfortable so might as well make everything else also easier and more comfortable. It's one click to change your scope currently. Just because it would be a realistic change doesn't mean that it's needed. [deleted] I did unlock the bipod for my bipod The thing is: That same feature exists in Arma as well. Of course you can go to your Inventory, change scopes back an forth and do that. But it would be way more awesome to have a Reddot on your ACOG and quickly switch with a single click of a button between House-combat or CQB. Me Arma isn't pubg. It literally just makes it easier. It removes dangerous encounters at close range as well if you've been spotting with a 4x and someone somehow got close. Being able to change to a reddot makes this stupid easy while learning to spray with a 4x actually takes skill. _irl e Goodbye. You say \"Goodbye\" and I say \"Hello, hello, hello\".

This could be because they want something to form the framework for future updates, or because they want to test certain features before bringing them in.\n\nIt isn't a question of difficulty to implement, rather, it is more having a plan for the long term. Because game development takes time and some of those \u201cissues\u201d (e.g. ear shattering sounds) are not issues but the fault of the user. That's definitely not true. The latter part.  How the fuck would the mods know. That's fair but how would things such as reducing sound levels on the redzone, fixing the lobby (not reverting our game mode to standard TPP) and other minor fixes that have nothing to do with gameplay get in the way of the road map? The edit...?  I'd imagine they want to focus development time on certain things, then have a downtime for general QOL fixes and community suggestions, it wouldn't make sense to move resources to something that, for all intents and purposes, isn't a major issue.\n\n I hear you. But for the players, isn't the feel of the game just as important as the actual state of it? Many bugs like these actually add up to a major one, feel wise. People are leaving in droves because it doesn't 'FEEL' polished.  The development of PubG is very much operated like a buisness, i'd imagine, developers will no doubts have things they *want* to work on, but their workflow is dictated to them instead of being chosen by them individually.\n\n Outstanding answer. I appreciate you. It sounds as if it should be obvious, and it pretty much is, but it's so easy to forget when you're frustrated and down on your luck. No problem, that's just my thoughts on how it possibly works.

Finally able to get 1:1 sensitivity. They'll fix it before it hits live servers And it remembers your choice after closing the game and coming back to it hours later! My favorite is knowing your grenade will hit an object in front of you in TPP Wait... so you're telling me that the technology has been here the whole time?!?! 0_o I want EU test servers.. Sucks to play on NA/AS with 3-400ms ping. When will this patch hit live servers?\n [deleted] Why hasn't it been fixed for months? It's literally the most trivial thing to fix and can't take more than 1 minute of coding. Took only a year to fix. If they only had trillions of dollars, probably could made it month faster... let's give them more money guys!  To be honest I was wondering why aiming felt so different. Couldnt quite place it. Awesome!  Wait, there is no EU test server? Now a lot of things make sense to me.. Agreed. I would rather play on test servers but its just too laggy with the server being other side of the world :( 3 ping pretty good tho there are a few inconvenient NA instances for us europeans, but 90% of the games i play feel pretty snappy like no difference to EU servers.\n\ne: i can understand being voted down, i should have stated i have a fiber connection with pings around 60-90 from DE to US AWS/Azure.\n 3 to 400? \n\nWhat's wrong with 3 ping /s  We've made a huge amount of changes and need time to gather feedback. We'll be testing this one for longer than usual, as mentioned in the patch notes. \n\nWe will push this patch to live as soon as reasonably possible after carefully examining player feedback, as well as other data and making additional changes where necessary :) People use that? Remember the part where this game had 10-15 people working on it when it went into EA, and was basically an indie game? They're unscrambling a lot of spaghetti code for things like this.... It's not 1:1 by default. You have to change the vertical sensitivity to 1.42.\n\n\n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/8f3hsq/psa_11_mouse_sensitivity_fix_on_test_servers_426/ Yeah.. I checked this site https://pubg.disquse.ru/ for the ping.\n\nI have about 150 to NA and 300 to AS.. But still.. 150ms is noticable.. Im used to 20-70ms Same for me. Very few issues. Sound is horrible tho, I don't know what happened there. Thanks for the awesome response! I must have missed the longer testing in the patch notes long as i can play it on test server tho im happy!  That still isn't 1:1 Yeah its the same for me. I jumped on the testserver yesterday and was wondering why it took so long to open doors and pickup loot... :D <3 Thanks for playing! It never gets any less awesome hearing players are happy and excited to play our game.\n\n*Also, here is the quote from the patch notes about the test duration if you're interested!*\n>Weapon balance in particular is really important for us, and we want to take the time to get it right. For this reason, we\u2019re going to keep the changes on the test server for longer than we normally would. We\u2019ll be listening and and making changes based on your feedback before pushing this update to live. So please share your thoughts with us! it is pre set to AS tho, might want to check that first You guys have definitely made me excited to ay again with these recent changes.  Actually communicating and seeing actual balances is amazing its starting to feel like a full game. Thanks a lot for the part in patch notes too!

AK has the best iron sight of all the ARs Still easier to point it at an enemy and seeing the enemy move.  best in the game. Mmm, flat plane that completely obstructs anything below the aimpoint. Ive heard battered woman with a better grasp of whats good for them than ur statement no visual obstruction vs entire visual obstruction... the fuck are you talking about.  Not to me, that's my issue with it. As soon as a scope is in the equation I love the gun. Why would you need to look what's below the aim point? I don't need to see the body if I have my aim on the head.  Guess he forgot to add 12 btw They move down a plane, into the aks model and it becomes harder to track where to put the gun.

I think the best characteristic of a crate weapon is it\u2019s situational uniqueness. That\u2019s why the SAW, for it\u2019s full auto, low recoil, high Mag capacity, and the AWM, headshot anything ability, are great crate weapons. The others don\u2019t really match up. Honestly, most of the time I find a groza or AUG, I already have something I like to use more, and I\u2019ll just take the ammo. The mk14 is really just between the an m24 and a groza, and I would much rather just keep what I already have. The M24 is just a shitty AWM or a flashy Kar. In the grand scheme, most of them aren\u2019t really worth it. \n\nNow there are ways to fix this, in my opinion. I was thinking about it a lot last night, and I feel like the current direction being taken with weapon introduction is uniqueness. I feel like a better approach would be variety. This would fall in line with Bluehole\u2019s wish that weapon choice was based on preference, not that one weapon is inherently better than the rest. This goes beyond just crate weapons as well.\n\nTake a look at what we currently have, 4 5.56 ARs, 3 oh which are full auto. Granted they have their differences, but the overall functionality of all is the same. Imagine if we had this with other weapons. \n\nNow imagine bolt action rifles. We have the Kar, but what if the Mosin, Lee Enfield, or Springfield were added. They all do the same damage as one another, but possibly they have differences due to their dimensions. Possibly one has less sway or longer ability to be held steady. Maybe one bolts a little faster. Or possibly one has a quicker ADS time. We have different sights between 4x on ak and 556 weapons. Maybe the new rifles have different scope reticles. If the goal is variety, add variety.\n\nWith crate weapons, the same idea could be applied. Why have a functionally identical bolt action rifle in a crate as one in world spawn. Make the m24 as deadly as the AWM, but change the mechanics. Add a situational uniqueness to the mk14 that separates it from world spawn DMRs. It has a bipod, maybe severely eliminate recoil when prone? The AUG and the Groza are a bit more difficult, which makes me feel like they\u2019d be better off as extremely rare world spawn weapons. After all, the groza is basically just a faster shooting ak, and I\u2019ll keep my m4 when I find an AUG. crate weapons should have abilities that reflect the difficulty in obtaining them.\n\nFor other weapons, I think the same idea applies. These are just the main ones I\u2019ve been thinking about. Variety would just be really cool. Maybe I has a disillusion considering I have 1000+ hours in this game, so I think there is less variety than there is, but I feel like any shot at any distance, I can tell you what weapon it is by sound. Also, the longer you last in a game, the pool of weapon differences comes down to like 5 different guns. \n\nThese are just my thoughts. If you disagree, I\u2019d love to hear what you dislike or any criticism. If you agree, I\u2019d love to hear what you\u2019d add.", "title": "Personal ideas for weapon changes to add variety.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/8h3or6/personal_ideas_for_weapon_changes_to_add_variety/", "gencomments": " Love the idea! bump"}], [{"author": "Trini_Gamer10", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/8hbfwy/the_no_footstep_exploit_really_needs_to_be/", "id": "8hbfwy", "selftext": "Just tapping your move forward key fast, but not fast enough to cause continuous walking, is enough to have completely silent footsteps.

Why can people hear me walking inside a house when they are 50 feet outside it? Do I have lead boots on? I think you got it backwards. Footsteps should be way quieter, and you should be almost silent if moving slowly enough.  Did you report it as a bug on the forums? to me it seems balanced by how slow it is. if somebody has enough time to sneak up on you doing that you either missed them earlier as they approached or were camping and deserve getting counterplayed. I never said that walking slowly making little noise was a problem. Tapping W and physically making zero sound is the problem.  he didnt mention anything about realism in his post\n\nthe game has a way to be \"quiet\" you can walk/crouch\n\ndoing a specific thing with the keys to achieve something not intended however is bad\n\n It's still exploiting a glitch. If holding ctrl or another keybind gave that effect I would have no problem with it. It's not a problem because everyone can do it. It's not some complex thing that only a few people can do.

Just last match I ditched my M416 and went with the UMP and Kar98k, and it was feeling really good!  In fact, I almost wonder if SMG's might be teetering on the edge of being slightly OP...\n\nWhat might make SMG's OP isn't any one thing, there's a few factors:\n\n1. Hipfire: Their hipfire is accurate, obviously.\n\n2. Movement Speed: You move faster with SMG's than with other primary weapons.  This is especially noticeable when ADSing with the micro uzi, you feel like you're just flying around.\n\n3. ADS Speed: This one is probably often overlooked, but wow is that ADS speed fast now.  Put a thumb grip on the UMP and it feels nearly instant!\n\n4. Recoil: All of the SMG's are pretty dang stable now, especially the UMP (it's a laser with attachments).\n\n5. Damage Multipliers: Here's something I realized; while SMG's might not have crazy DPS at first glance, they have higher limb damage multipliers, meaning that you're actually going to deal more damage with SMG shots than AR shots a lot of the time, and that's on top of the recent SMG damage buff (and AR damage nerf).\n\nI'm definitely glad to see the AR's dethroned from being the kings of all ranges, but wow, SMG's are in a weird spot...  Nobody seems to be using them, but they have several factors right now that, in my mind, make them terrifying.", "title": "What is the Consensus on SMG's Right Now? OP or Still \"Meh\"?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/8iamok/what_is_the_consensus_on_smgs_right_now_op_or/", "gencomments": " I think the main reason people steer away from them is because of the range disadvantage. idk why the UMP was part of the recoil buffs they did. It was pretty darn easy to control before, IMO.\n\nim sure people will catch on The ump is amazibg for close range now, ADS is almost unnecessary, and even spraying at medium range. For medium-long I would rather have m4 and dmr /kar98 still though The UMP never wasnt OP. Just never used compared to the ARs being so much better. If anything I am seeing a huge increase in smg and ak use The smgs still aren't as versatile. The ump, for example, has one of the highest ttks In the game. At close range, this means basically any gun, including the buffed 1911, will out shoot it. It's not a weak gun, as long as you don't get in a dps race in VS someone who can control their recoil. At mid range a good AR user will shit on the ump because you can still tap incredibly quickly and accurately on anything minus the m16, which is complete shit now. \n\nThe other smgs are Hella strong close range, but falloff quickly a bit further, and if you run k98 with them you are going g to have a massive range that you are ineffective at, so ar/k98 is preferred to smg/k98.\n\nSmgs pair really well with the DMRs, although I would still trade out the ump for an AR since I can control my recoil and would prefer the higher dps.  Yeah, you'll still want an AR for long range until you find a sniper/DMR, but either one of those with an SMG seems to give you a better loadout than if you had an AR in either slot!\n\nAnd yeah, the UMP didn't need recoil buffs along with all the other buffs and AR nerfs, haha.  It's honestly kinda insane right now, and I didn't think too highly of it before. Well, the UMP was in a weird spot.  It was very stable and reliable, but it didn't have the DPS or other advantages to make it worth using.  UMP vs M416 would result in you getting shredded by the higher DPS of the M416.\n\nYou're absolutely right about more people using the AKM!  I'm glad to see it not being a trash weapon again! I used to absolutely agree with the idea that the UMP was weak.  That TKK was just too long.  However, between all of the SMG buffs and AR nerfs, the UMP is just an insane laser now, and it feels like the average TTK is a lot faster (probably due to damage buff + limb damage increase).\n\nWith >1,000 hours in the game, I can spray with an AR, but SMG's are feeling **good!** I mean it's ttk IS high and there's no amount of skill that can change that. It will lose a dps race every time.\n\nI use it hyper effectively myself, but I still do better with other guns just because the ttk for them are lower. The AKM especially feels great right now, I hope they keep it as is. The extra recoil doesn't matter since it's mostly vertical and you'll ko anyone before it starts getting that horizontal kick.\n\nLike I don't want people thinking I'm calling the ump bad, especially because if you play it right you shouldn't be getting into dps races if you can help it. It's just that you need to beware that you will lose if an enemy forces it or if you keep putting yourself into positions where you end in dps races. If you can stay out of DPS races, ump is top notch and scary no matter who is wielding it.  Well, it'll still lose a DPS race to an M416, sure, but otherwise I don't think it's as bad as you're implying.  When its DPS was 380, sure, it struggled.  Now its DPS is 423.  The SCAR's DPS is 447.  That's not much of a difference, and the UMP is often going to have a lower TTK than the SCAR due to its faster rate of fire.  Factor in limb hits, which the UMP will deal more damage with, and your average TTK difference between the UMP and SCAR is pretty dang low.  Then consider the outrageously-fast ADS speed of the UMP and how you'll start shooting sooner than the enemy...\n\nAgain, I absolutely advocated **against** the UMP before this patch.  It was easy to use but it didn't have any advantages to make up for its terrible TTK.  Now its TTK is better and it gained a handful of other great advantages as well.\n\nThe one gun that I'm sure we'd agree on, though, is the Vector...  You'd be wrong to not fear a decked-out Vector! Vector is godlike "}], [{"author": "softskiller", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/8ijh4u/top_players_with_their_secret_of_success/", "id": "8ijh4u", "selftext": "", "title": "Top Players with their secret of success", "url": "https://i.redd.it/w3o554sz94x01.png", "gencomments": ""}], [{"author": "Kjiel", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/8isbhc/it_seems_like_someone_urgently_had_to_go_to_the/", "id": "8isbhc", "selftext": "", "title": "It seems like someone urgently had to go to the bathroom.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/k7bcjl28ebx01.jpg", "gencomments": " Ate too many apples..."}], [{"author": "Tentarro", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/8j00q8/found_out_why_i_never_hear_people_sneaking_up_on/", "id": "8j00q8", "selftext": "If you slowly, slowly inch up, you don't make any foot steps.

Runs fine. \n\nNot everyone plays on low The main reason is that they use UE4. Now it's not a bad engine but it was designed with this type of large scale game in mind.\n\nIf PUBG had built their own engine they could have had much more control over what to render when etc.\n\nNow they get what UE gives them.\n\nWith Fortnite there seems some optimizations for these type of games are being implemented into the engine though so hopefully PUBG will see some benefits of that too along the way. I run it on high/ultra and have no complaints. Game runs great. Piss poor optimization. Really bad dev team?\n\nOnly answer is to just accept the game runs really bad, it's not what you want to hear but just expect nothing but garbage.\n\nAlso could be worse, Battlefield 1 has an issue where it just randomly uses 100% of my CPU at all times leading to shit tier FPS. At least PUBG kind of works.  What are your specs? I know not everyone, that's why I wrote most of us in the post What specs?  That's the thing, people have random issues with games, but over all they run fine on most PCs. I run BF1 on High and get stable 60fps without breaking a sweat, but PUBG is all over the place and it's bottomed out on the settings. It's just weird to me. I'd get it if it was the most beautiful game on the market with raytraced reflections, god rays, particle effects and all the bells and whistles. 3570k OC@4.4, 1060 6gb, 16gb ddr3 @1866 on an SSD 6700k, gtx1080, 1440p 144hz It's basically just a really poorly made game, and a dev team that aren't very good at making games. \n\nBattlefield 1 runs pretty well when it works, because DICE is competent at game making, although still retarded.

I never put any ops more than 2x on a groza  What did u expect with a groza with a 3x the fun is known to have massive recoil Groza got smacked with a way too hard nerf after the update, now it is bad :( why's the scope shaking like crazy when spraying? With that distance and especially with that scope, you're better off going single shot with the Groza and just tap firing, works surprisingly well as a make shift DMR despite the short stature. I would say only use it in full auto at SMG distance, but after the recent patch SMGs are lasers. totally worth it It's always fun when you can get that last second kill before you die. I don\u2019t know who shot at who first, but people who sit in the blue (late game) or decide to shoot at someone running in while circle is moving in on both of you, I dislike with a passion \ud83d\ude02. Idk if they\u2019re \n1) not aiming to win (which to wait until late game to die is pointless, just hot drop)\n2) horrible players with no thought process/game sense\n3) people like you who say \u201cfck it, I ain\u2019t making it\u201d (which we\u2019ve all done before) lol\n4) new players who don\u2019t understand mechanics yet\n5) lastly, people with no soul (which ties to number 3) You\u2019re the asshole that pisses me off in games. You could have stayed alive if you sprinted for the circle and that dude would have died to the wall. But you kill whored instead. Smh you can land shots like that with the k98 but you're playing tpp. welp\n\nowell at least you won't be killing me in fpp :D Yeah, I'm never putting that on something Auto again. I can't find a use for it. Cant spray with it because its just not comfortable. Cant use long range because it obscures too much of the view. Useless scope that should be removed. It's fine for spraying with UMP/M249/Dp28. Otherwise tapping with ARs/DMR is fine.  \n\nIn general though I agree. I would rather have a 2x or a 4x in just about every scenario. 3rdPP LUL what are you... Bot?  How would I go about doing this? I was unaware What? It's so fucking good lmao. That time to kill is insane and it has significantly less recoil than the AK which everyone loves now In this clip the enemy was at what I consider still SMG range. Almost out of it though, but still in. Looks more like OP hasn't used groza much before and wasn't too familiar with the recoil. In which case it would indeed have been better for him to use single fire. He was dead no matter what. If you gotta go take someone with you. Don\u2019t tell me that you wouldn\u2019t do the same thing if you knew you couldn\u2019t make it to the next circle. He had less than 1/4 health and with the damage rate, he knew he was fucked and just wanted the extra kill Actually check my account. I'm 90 pecent fpp. Gf was playing and she got a phone call half way through so I took over I recently put it on a Scar and tapfired and it was fine. I still don't get why we need 7 types of sights I like it, I use it for spraying\n The zoom amount is good, I just hate the reticle. So much cancer clutter. I only have one pp :c https://pubg.op.gg/user/Froddoyo?server=na\n\nGo to season 5. I play fpp 90% of the time but the moment I play tpp I get something Reddit worthy. How weird.. There's a few different ways of doing it. You could use similar sites to the one for the GIF or download a program like Handbrake for some impressive compression. Has more recoil than ak which is why this guy missed all his shots in the vid (side to side recoil impossible to compensate for) I mean I'm not saying it's not possible, but especially with that scope going full auto from that distance isn't ideal, especially if you arn't used to Groza recoil.\n\nAs I said, SMGs are lasers now, so pretty much the entire circle is \"SMG range\", but realistically you wouldn't be able to go full auto with a real SMG past around 25 meters. I would of ran circle and went for the chance the guy misses me too much till he has to run due to circle. Is rather die going for the option to win then die for a single kill. A quick turn spray to make them rethink shooting you would be about all i would do.  [deleted] Second that The first 15 bullets go straight up basically, go look at the WJ charts.  It's definitely controllable up to like 100 m, you just have less time practicing with it so it feels off. Red, Holo, x2, x3, x4, x6, x8, x15 that's ~~7~~ 8 Purhapse Did they remove 15?

Cs Go, Battlefield 1 or every Other frag game, but not this crate pimp  Spray paterens arent the same thats the problem...  Try Arma. Regarding to brendan and the dev team.

Yes I also play battle royal  Don't worry guys, [I fixed it](https://i.imgur.com/hRfI0X5.jpg) so please stop PMing me about getting a royale with cheese.

Gonna get sued for having guns i love how you can put any attachment on just about any gun. like the winchester being useful by being able to put a scope on it, or suppressing your crossbow. But when I post memes here it gets removed cuz it's \"Low effort\" content. [I said the REAL battle royal game ](https://imgur.com/gallery/GXnGwBK) \n\n If it had Au servers :( royal e Legit good though. Literally never upset.\n\nThey've somehow found balance between a katana and a barrett and its fun. Nah man u gotta get that palidins battle Royale The guns in TABG feel really good to shoot. Too bad the servers work 50% of the time. Um, I think you mean snowball fights in Club Penguin FYI It's battle *royale*. (Like the movie) in b4 removed for low effort The gum is perfection My friend recited this exact meme before seeing it. Should I be concerned? I prefer the real battle royale: Minecraft Hunger Games  This but unironically I prefer Mcchicken royal. this one replaced fortnite for me, but i still play pubg for the more gritty hardcore action Before I logged off, 37k on just the first US server. This game received a ton of attention, which is good, because the game is super fun. Oh boy, is it already time for another lawsuit? I'm gonna get my popcorn... Can we copystrike tabg Minecraft hunger games is the original\n Who else can\u2019t connect to any games??\n\nIt\u2019s down in US for some reason?

IMO pubg should be first then fortnite gay lol Why post this here though? It has literally nothing to do with pubg. I wonder if gangsta mode actually does anything other than making ads terrible?\n\nAnd giving away your position. And then being ragdolled across the map How do you akimbo  And oh boy are there some weapons There's many hidden weapons actually that you can only get in the actual game, like the Really Big Barret, or the boxing gloves.  Not every single weapon Holy shit why doesnt pubg have this and why did I not even have this complaint until now.... Once you can connect to a server... tell me your secret to finding a game. What is the game called It\u2019s legit fucking awful. It\u2019s not even fun as a shitty knock off.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m very confused. You guys realize I\u2019m talking about Totally Accurate, right? I agree completely. I hope people can learn again how to have fun without the hyper-competitive aspect. It makes it really genuine, though it is capable of being a masterpiece of weird mechanics if people do try to take it to that level, and it if lag isn't a major restriction. \n\nUsing (dual-handed!!!) melee weapons is actually rewarding because of the weird physics so it's really an awesome style of gameplay.   I agree, but this game is just supposed to be an late april fools joke. Something they do every year. Dont get your hopes too high. Rec Royale represent And here I am, still waiting for Landfall to finally finish TABS instead of releasing joke games. It's a novelty surrounded by a massive amount of issues. It's just a fad unless they fix a lot of the problems that makes this game unique  Damn auto correct. I'm only upset that the version I made for /r/fortniteBR (with the correct spelling) got taken down for low effort. Why even have a meme flair :(\n\nEdit: I must emphasize I'm a moron for not noticing. [Here is a correction.](https://i.imgur.com/txQUEl6.jpg)\nSecond Edit: [Updated OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/8pqnov/updated_i_prefer_real_battle_royale_games/) Huh...quite the comment graveyard below. [removed] Africa is the only REAL battle royale survival games*  Totally Accurate Battlegrounds The pan in that game is legit named \"shallow pot with a long handle\". Top kek This will probably too granted I do think it qualifies as commentary? Maybe? My crosspost to /r/fortnightbr got removed though :(  In America it's a Battle Quarter Pounder  Too much players + not enough servers = bad time  Bro I fucking love Kirby Air Ride!!!! It makes you 200% cooler and plays epic music. Its also pretty funny to do xD Changes position of barrel for corners, can \u201csafe peak\u201d if you know someone\u2019s there, makes pre-firing certain corners more in your favour \n\nAlso it\u2019s amazing to do with the Gatling gun  Every true hood gangsta knows it increases your cool factor and weapon accuracy by a minimum of 25&#37;, depending on how many fools' you've capped before. [deleted] The Liberator Minigun is the best by far. Ultimate freedom machine. I just like the fact you can add a suppressor on the rocket launcher. My favorite thing i found so far was a periscope site and barrel was very interesting  [deleted] In PUBG Mobile you have a shooting range with a \"parkour\" area, and a race track. Patience. There's not that many players over there, so it takes awhile. I wasn\u2019t able to connect but I got an update today and I was able to connect finally! Switch to Asia servers. I get games in a matter of seconds and the lag isn't too bad either.  the servers weren't made for so many people, just gotta be patient. EU servers After the first night i was able to fine a match pretty easily US2.  Just go on the EU servers I always find games there Asia servers Use Asian servers if US is having problems Totally accurate battlegrounds. It's free on Steam for a limited time  Who shit in your frootloops today?....... ok, but why tho But why is there autocorrect on your image editing program? yeah, some kid that doesn't like wrestling clearly triggered his favorite video game is named after a gimmick wrestling match and is not taking the news very well. [removed] Irl Still free. Probably because you insulted their sacred game lol ohhhh\n\nMaybe that\u2019s why my friends and i can\u2019t queue.\n\nClearly they didn\u2019t expect this many players then I mean, City Trial was basically the father of all battle royale games.\n\n\nYou get dropped in a big area with multiple players with next to nothing, and you have to come out and be the best Best time is telling out let's get this sucka and akimbo glocks to the last guy Not just pistols, you can dual wield any combination of one handed weapons. Pressing 0 now, sir And the crossbows I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re being down voted . You absolutely can get the boxing gloves. I hammered the hell out of a guy with them. \n\nEdit: it\u2019s late. I didn\u2019t word a read right. :/ There\u2019s 26k people right now  Oh! I was about to give up and try Realm Royale.  It\u2019s a battle royale buffet right now. Thanks for the heads up friend  No one? Just because I\u2019m calling a bad game bad? What do you mean? [removed] [removed] Yea I probably should have flipped the two first images on theirs. I'm really liking the Akimbo tec-9's but there so hard to find  And VSS, put a suppressor on that suppressor. Because the OP said that you can only find the boxing gloves IN THE GAME, just not in the Training Grounds, and both of you are just agreeing with him. Yeah he's wrong on the reason why people can't find games. Their aren't enough servers. Yeah and 25999 people who don't want to play with you Realm Royale actually has some pretty neat ideas.\n\nI personally love there being so many options in the genre. Everybody has their own twist on it, and I like seeing how that shakes up gameplay. Says the commenter unironically on the PUBG subreddit lmao You made a claim and failed to back it up with a why and just came off as an asshole.\n [removed] [removed] Yea u should've, that would've been free karma  But dude. You don\u2019t understand. They ARE in the game.  Not really. Not enough servers is a problem, but you guys who say this keep forgetting about the part where games like PUBG, or TAB, fill lobbies with lots of players.\n\nI'm not sure what TAB's max player count is, but at 100, that's only 260 games. At 50, it's 520. And with players getting staggered in and out it can cause a long matchmaking time, especially if there's any kind of matchmaking block or splitting among the playerbase (squads/duos/solo, for example).  I\u2019ve been playing battle royale since the early days of the mod in Arma 3, it\u2019s great to see so many people exposed to the mode and the new fresh takes.   I like the feel of PUBG the best, but all of these are fun to try and put time into.\n\nIsn\u2019t there a Mad max style one with everyone spawning with cars? The fucking hitboxes though? I don't even aim at people and hit them. ...are you saying everyone here is here ironically? ??? What do you mean? It\u2019s a terrible game. I have to say why? What the fuck is this place? [removed] [removed] quite sure a game max count is 40 40 per game and each game lasts like 15 minutes usually. It's honestly pretty easy to find a game during off-peak hours  There\u2019s no really block. If you inv another friend you play with them. If you don\u2019t you play by yourself. > Isn\u2019t there a Mad max style one with everyone spawning with cars?\n\nYou're probably thinking of [Fractured Lands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TfdpjGVz0w) yeah i think its a version of h1z1 And all of them are so different and so much fun! I'm loving the variety right now. No it's ironic that you call that game bad, while playing PUBG which is buggy unoptimized trash. If you want for your opinion to have any credibility you do. I like to hear bad reviews but give me something substantial. You don't *have* to, but when you are so passionate about a differing opinion, naturally people will want to know why?\n\nIf you don't want to explain, that's fine, but you don't have to be so defensive.  It just seemed by your initial post, you'd be able to be passionate in a response about why you dislike it so much :) It's a good game, then. You're wrong. [removed] [removed] Or this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjWLDrJ5JPw This game is even worse than PUBG. Have you even played it? Okay. Here ya go. It\u2019s terrible. Does that help? I wasn\u2019t defensive. I said it was shit and people jumped on me lol. ??? Have you played it? [removed] TABZ is cartoony, silly, and literally made as an april fools joke, so bugs are a lot more acceptable.  PUBG is years under development, and going for a combat simulator theme, so bugs aren't acceptable in this game. Substantial. Something of substance. That tells me nothing. I'm sure you'll figure it out! Good luck.  Does your vote count look like it helped? It\u2019s a good game, fun and weird. Screw off  [removed] Okay. But. TABZ is still awful even as a joke. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. Do you care about downvotes? Lol. No. It\u2019s weird. And wacky. But it\u2019s honestly terrible. Fuck off. Anyone that thinks it\u2019s good should really reconsider their definition of good. [removed] They are an indications of public sentiment.  Right now you can see that nobody is interested in what you're saying. I think you just hate everything  Its fucking so much fun,and guess what?you cant change that or take it from me.cya mr negative nancy :) They actually are VERY interested in what I\u2019m saying. That\u2019s why everyone is still responding to me. Dumbass lol. Nope. I enjoy PUBG. I also like war zone. Enjoy OW and StarCraft. Like Nintendo games. Most of them anyway. Only fun for someone with brain damage. Have a good time! Yeah buddy you're totally coming out on top nice work Oh okay so the problem is that you are boring  Lol. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m coming out on top. But you said people have no interest in what I had to say. If that was the case, why are people responding to me more than anyone else in this thread? Exactly. Check. Mate. Retard. How am I boring for not liking a really shit game that has loads and loads of issues? What the fuck is your problem? Dullllll Okay. So you have nothing to say lol."}], [{"author": "thecoolbrian", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/8px03k/pubg_world_record_back_flips/", "id": "8px03k", "selftext": "", "title": "PUBG World Record Back Flips!", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/attribution_link?a=ejDYZX31gIg&amp;u=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DFG1DZcRVX8k%26feature%3Dshare", "gencomments": " There is so much wrong with this clip"}], [{"author": "Nu1usive", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/8q51tx/my_weirdest_pubg_win_more_sanhok_strategies/", "id": "8q51tx", "selftext": "", "title": "My Weirdest PUBG Win &amp; More Sanhok Strategies", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfp5bvAz-HM", "gencomments": ""}], [{"author": "ref_", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/8qe78n/bathroom_party/", "id": "8qe78n", "selftext": "", "title": "Bathroom party", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yf2eo5nal-s", "gencomments": ""}], [{"author": "MintChocChip6", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/8qnwjn/my_friends_sweet_headshot_with_a_crossbow_plus_a/", "id": "8qnwjn", "selftext": "", "title": "My friend's sweet headshot with a crossbow (plus a sawed-off kill)", "url": "https://v.redd.it/1joi3lnzrn311", "gencomments": " he didnt even have anything I dont understand why this is so sweet"}], [{"author": "CluelessNETuser", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/8qx9jx/nothing_convinced_me_more/", "id": "8qx9jx", "selftext": "That the only reason why PUBG lost some momentum is because of pubg corp's own issues.

First impressions are important and they don't have a good one if you ask me. > I don't understand why Fortnite overtook PUBG the way it did\n\nI don't think they took over at all. To me they are not targeting the same players at all.\n\nFortnite is friendly for the whole family and it's free for BR and the cartoonish style make it a lot more attractive to kids. About kids, most of my colleagues' ones play Fortnite now for these reasons.\n\nOn the other side, PUBG is not noob-friendly, is quite tough and not for everyone (it remains a slow paced FPS). It is more of a niche game (one game mode : BR which is an FPS game mode only while Fortnite proposes other game modes).\n\nIn the end, I wouldn't compare both games that much. I don't know why people focus so much on it. \n\n/r/CluelessNETuser you should ask those that stop playing PUBG what games they play now and you'll see almost no PUBG players are shifting to Fortnite. They go play other genre or CS:GO if they keep playing FPS games. So defenitely, fortnite isn't overtaking PUBG.  Had a 10 months break from the game and just came back. Holy. Shit. The amount of cheaters.\n\nAnd wtf have they done to the end circles? If you win now it\u2019s 50% skill 50% if you get the circle RNG on your side.\n\nRead a while ago that they wanted the next circles to appear less in the center. But this is just ridiculous. They always appear on the edges now and someone is now bound to get the circle in hos favor. Add that to the fact that Fortnite is free and you have this result. In no other scenario you would see Fortnite with more playerbase than PUBG. Its a inferior game in my book. 100&#37; correct and pubg will continue to \"do it to themselves\"\n\nupvoted op I don't understand your reasoning at all. Both are battle royale games, so both can be grouped in that genre even if the playstyles are different.\n\n[Fortnite has WAY more players, with about double the concurrent amount of players than PUBG](https://www.pcgamesn.com/fortnite/fortnite-vs-pubg-map-players-graphics-gameplay-weapons-review#playercount)\n\nHow, in your mind, has Fortnite not overtaken PUBG? No, they're not exactly the same, but Quake and UT were never exactly the same and yet they competed against each other - PUBG and Fortnite compete against each other as well as against all the other battle royale games that have been popping up like weeds, and will compete with CoD's Battle Royale. Are you only playing tpp? Because that would explain both situations  Inferior how?\n\nJust curious because from a tech stand point, Fortnite is superior in every way. Network lag is some of the lowest of any game, runs very well, plays very well, regular bug/content update.\n\nOnly thing PUBG has is \"grown ups game\". PUBG is trash. Also 30$ game and still having to pay for skins LUL It technically is a better game\n You might not like the mechanics in it. But pugb couldn't code their way out a wet paper bag. > In no other scenario you would see Fortnite with more playerbase than PUBG.\n\nYou're wildly delusional. Uh... how does the perspective you play in affect where the fucking circle is, dude I don\u2019t care about skins or paying for the game. I don\u2019t like the cartoonish playing of Fortnite or the fact you can just build barriers  Network lag is some of the lowest in any game? The fuck, fortnite feels like fuckin 16tick garbage its a kids game dude and the gunplay is shit Because a not dumb as fuck player would know how to flank in this situation. Except on maybe erangel God I hate the map. And in tpp it's almost impossible due to you guessed it. Perspective  That's like, your opinion man.\n\nFor real, it's just your opinion, just the guy above me called it \"inferior\" which kind of sounds douchy to me. \n\nI would probably play Fortnite if the keybindings weren't garbage, pretty sure they don't even have the option for hold to crouch .  The building is part is a skill cap to the game though. Part of the intrigue. That's like saying you don't like the fact you could demolish building in Battlefield to flush out or kill players. I love Fortnite for a very different reason, but PUBG is my favourite battle royale by far. FN feels smooth in gameplay, but holy shit dying behind walls happens so frequently in the game.\n\nJust today, i was fighting someone. Id peak, shoot, miss, get behind a wall, they'd hit me. It was ridiculous It competes with CSGOs 60hz servers, yes the netcode is apparently fantastic in Fortnite. Never actually played it.\n\nAlthough I question the source, the same guy (battlenonsense) also found the Battlefields netocde was good too, except Battlefield has terrible netcode and is always laggy even with low ping, in fact low ping players are the laggiest. So maybe on paper the netcode is good, but when you add all the elements of the game together it goes to shit.  >wildly delusional Okay my first reply was way too hostile and toxic, and I apologize.\n\n\\>  Read a while ago that they wanted the next circles to appear less in the center. But this is just ridiculous. They always appear on the edges now and someone is now bound to get the circle in hos favor. \n\nI want to know if that's got anything to do with FPP or TPP, honestly I have no idea. It\u2019s part of the game yes , but that\u2019s the reason I don\u2019t enjoy Fortnite.  64tick is fucking aids in csgo stfu you manlet  No offense taken. No this has nothing to do with perspective they just changed it so it isn't all the time in the center of the map. But all the other circles should be pretty similar.

Any development time used on people trying to maintain their 1990's technology just hurts the real players.  If you REALLY wanna play at 4:3 on Fullscreen, the only solution I've found was by changing my monitor's native resolution with CRU. \n\nAfter many hours wasted trying to figure it out and I finally managed to play at 1440x1080 Fullscreen, I realized that 4:3 sucks in PUBG lmao. You can, but only in fullscreen windowed mode which gives you mouse latency. And what classifies as a real player? You could choose any resolution you wanted before 1.0 though. It doesn't make sense why they decided to block it."}], [{"author": "goatonastik", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/8s4b7d/stop_hitting_yourself/", "id": "8s4b7d", "selftext": "", "title": "Stop hitting yourself!", "url": "https://i.imgur.com/VU9m0a1.jpg", "gencomments": " he killed himself by blow up a car with his punch?

People are not going to pay lots of money for something just because it is rare, it also has to be something they want. Because you get 98 more items and not only the scar skin The whole crate system is retarded. thats the reason why i always sold the crates and bought the skins that i wanted The very basics of any economy  at these prices people who are spending money on keys are losing value right? If they are examining the prices and seeing that even if they get lucky they sell it for less than the expected value of the item, their incentive should be to never buy a key in the first place Already bought it on the market, look up my steam account its cap1tal1sm OK but you realize that people who are buying keys are losing value because even the good drops are not paying back the cost of the key.\n\nSo they are, in probabilistic expected value terms, destroying money by purchasing keys because even if they hit on the best items they're not selling it for their true value (expected number of attempts to win * $2.50)\n\nSO basically the only reason we are lucky enough to have skins to buy cheap is because idiots gamble with keys. According to this market no one should ever spend any money on a key, it's a losing bet TFW you studied economics at an Ivy league and some idiot on the internet is telling you \"hurr durr basic economics\"\n\nYou realize that at these prices people who are spending money on keys are losing value right? If they are examining the prices and seeing that even if they get lucky they sell it for less than the ***expected value*** of the item, their incentive should be to never buy a key in the first place ...................................\n\n............................ you get one item per $2.50 \"lottery ticket\" you buy.\n\nNow yes there are even more rare items with even lower probability, but even **those** aren't selling for their \"true\" value.\n\nIf you want to figure it out, check out the drop probabilities then figure out the expected number of times you have to try before you are \"expected\" to get the drop -- times that by $2.50 and you'll see it's WAY more than the actual market price\n\nEDIT: I think I see your point which is that \"out of 100 tries\" you also get the other skins... but if that's what you meant it's just as retarded because the high-probability items are literally worthless, so you lose even more money for them. So that's not a good point whatsoever Yes that is the optimal move to do that's what I'm saying, but it's inefficient for these skins to exist whatsoever The basics of an economy is a positive-sum gain for everyone, buyers and sellers benefit -- (consumer and producer \"surplus\" in an economic model)\n\nBut here, the \"Crate openers\" (Producers) are literally destroying value by buying keys, because the cost of the key is not worth the \"lottery price\" to get even the best skins. Like the Gold or Glory AK is selling for maybe $60, but the expected value of gambling with keys is somewhere in the thousands of dollars (In other words, if you were to abide by the law of large numbers you would need to drop $2000 in order to be \"expected\" to get that drop)\n\nSo basically it's a completely non-efficient market which should be impossible especially with Chinese algorithm traders playing the steam market Yes it's not profitable to just buy crates and keys and sell the contents.  No need, I was just being cheeky, read my post with a \";)\" at the end hehe MFW some kid on the internet thinks a dick waving contest makes him right. Your post clearly shows that you have a poor grasp on basic economics.

Pistols, and Boom sticks don't count)\nUse the sound to your advantage.\nListen for opponents but don't make to much noise if not necessary.\nYou can even bate them in to a trap with shooting 2 different guns making it sound like you are fighting somebody.\nMostly they just sprint right in to your gun..\nReposition after every kill quiet up, and listen.\nMake Shure you are fighting to one side, and that there is nobody to shoot you in the back.\nMove with the zone, as it closes, or play the center zone game with taking a compound, and holding it.\nThe rest is practice. Yo if you wanna run some duos or squads I\u2019d be down imo you have more time off drop to get a gun or two especially if it\u2019s not a very hot drop to get a feel for everything Itll come my dude.\n\nJust pick your battles. Have you tried to pull the weapons instead of clicking F to pick it up?\nIt increases my chance to survive once I drop. And if you hot dropped at Bootcamp, just go for rifles instead and you dont need to pick up an sniper til you feel safe around. >I\u2019ve never played a game I wasn\u2019t at least ok at after 100 hours\n\nIt\u2019s a trip, isn\u2019t it? This game is so frustrating.. so nerve racking. So addictive. And now You\u2019ve gotten a taste of top 10.. whew! Honestly I have hundreds of hours and only a handful of wins. I play to ruin people\u2019s lives and work on my KD. Also, I\u2019ve learned to dial in sniping, so I\u2019m always after distance kills now.\n\nMy best advice: \n\n1.find a spot on the map in a semi-rural area and get to know it like the back of your hand. From there start working on what I call my \u201chomestead strategy.\u201d  I know where I land, I know my next move, and I have developed from there.\n\n2. Hunt people; don\u2019t just shoot. Take your time, try and know where your enemy is, and work your way closer to be sure your shots earn you a kill rather than just give your position away.\n\n3. Be a pacifist. The only real reason to kill is pride or loot... if you have the loot and don\u2019t need the pride points, hang tight and survive. Senseless shooting will just give yourself away.\n\n4. Some might hate this, but when I was just earning my stripes I would set traps. Make a whole group of houses look untouched, drop my primary gun and ammo at the top of the stairs, and wait in the corner with my secondary ready to pop the fool who went to loot. It\u2019s shady, but it works and helps build confidence.\n\n5. Keep at it. I\u2019m not going to pretend like I\u2019m great at the game, but I\u2019ve gotten a lot better and definitely have my streaks. I rarely camp anymore and am much more confident running into battles. You\u2019ll get there. \n\nBetter luck next time! I can play some duos with you if you need some pointers. I've got close to 1000 hours on the game and hundreds of wins. i might be able to help! Check your sensitivity. I\u2019ve had a lot more luck by turning it down. Easier to aim in my opinion. \n\nAlso. Since there isn\u2019t a shooting range. Make your own. Drop far. Get guns. Go outside and shoot some stuff. Yes you will make noise. But so what. You will at least be able to feel the guns out. Mess with scopes.  Attachments. \n\nBut remember. Have fun! It\u2019s a game. And I try to tell myself that every time I start to get frustrated because I suck. \n\nGood luck, and see you out there.  Learning the layout is key to small fights. Use the cats defense mentality, always another way out. \n\nBuildings are more defendable, but trees are more versatile. Keep that in mind when you choose a fight.\n\nRemember you don't have to take every fight, learning when to back off is just as important as knowing when to press the attack.\n\nLearn a gun and stick with it.\n\nDon't be afraid to take a shot, the more shots you take, the more you hit. But sometimes by not taking the shot, you keep your position safe for the future.\n\nFor learning gunplay and fighting tactics, try running solo squads and landing hot. Get a gun and hold a room.\n\nOnce you know how and when to kill, start playing with the same people so you can work together and be more effective. Duos is fine for this.\n\nRemember, trying new things is just as good a way to learn, as doing the same thing many times.\n\nJust hit 800+ hours and I love every second of it! Feel free to message me with specific questions and I will get to you asap.  drop somewhere with no people. find a tree and shoot it until you feel like you can control the gun. then you kill people. I played 30+ hours and I average 2 kills/match but no wins but I get really close though You can aim, so dont hot drop. Its rng and bullshit. IMO you gain nothing from it.\n\nIf you can aim then the hardest thing to learn are the circle mechanics. People will tell you circles are all RNG but imo its not. Theres an art to it.\n\nAlso spotting people at distance. Dont learn that shit dying in the first minutes. Thanks homie. Is it better to post up in a building or on the ground in the trees? Also, when moving to the circle, is it better to stay on the outskirts to kill stragglers or move deep into the circle so you don't have to move as much? Yeah, I might hit you up for that. I've been told so many times here that hot dropping is the best way to improve your gun handling. One thing I cannot understand is the drop with sniper rifles. I've had a few Kar98s and a few M24s, but I cannot figure out the drop for them  because I almost never actually get to use them. The off chance I do get one I'll probably get smoked before I'm able to use it. Fuck man it takes every ounce of me not to hate this game. Been playing for 2 hours straight and have only gotten a single kill. I swear to god I\u2019m regressing in terms of skill. Something just feels off about this game.  I've got a couple 2nd places and a few 3rds but its mostly from just hiding and crawling around. If I have to engage people I get tossed almost every time. I wish they would implement a team death match mode just so I could get a feel for everything. I prefer high ground. Gives you more vision, and awareness.\nBuilding, bush, high ground it depends on the zone, and the next one.\nThe moment the blue zone closes open up the map mark the center of the new white zone, and think how am I going to get there, and how are my opponents going to get there.\nIf you are hearing shooting at that time you can paint your opponents path in your head while watching the map and thurning around.\n\nIn the beginning it is good to aim for around the midle of the circle.\nThis way you are guaranteed to be close to the next zone, and you limit your exposure to danger by not moving on the open unecesarily.\nOr you can tank the damage of the first zones.\nThey dont do much damage in the start.\nThis way by being late you make Shure most of the opponents are in front of you now, and you won't get shot in the back.\n\nBy the final 3 zones you want to make Shure to move on time or they will screw you up.\nGood tactic is to spiral around with the zone as it is closing.\nThat way you won't get backstabbed unless you stop.\nOther Player are probably doing the same.\nOr if the zone is to far.\nJust quietly go straight, and find good cover.\nBe aware that other players are circling around you while you do that.\n\nDon't make noise, and don't shoot if not apsolutly necessary unless you have a VSS\nIt can still be 1 vs 5... the moment you reveal your position you are screwed.\nSome times it's better to let the guy live, and use him as bate or detector.\n1vs2\nLet the other 2 guys start the end fight, and mop up the last guy.\n\nIt's a lot of adaptation, and experience.\nAwareness where you are in the space, and where your opponent could be is 50% of the game.\n\nP.S. grass doesn't render on more then 100m\nSo proning is only good in the last circles that are small.\nIf you have to hide or prone before do it in a bush, and hope nobody scopes in...\n\nHere, and then you will get killed by cheaters.\nMake Shure to report! www.ggnext.eu Yeah my friend and I got drop a lot just to get a lot of 1v1 interactions and sometimes 2v1 but I also have like 600 hours, but when I first started I kinda just took it slow and kinda learned everything piece by piece Hot dropping is not a very good strategy to practice gun handling because it has a huge random factor about it so you don't get to practice the guns you want, and you don't have any attachments for most of the fight so the guns handle different then they normally do when you're fully kitted.\n\nFor practice I would advise to pick a few medium traffic spots on the map and learn them well. Choose a spot that's 1-1.5km away from the plane path. That way you will get an early fight, but you have more room to manuever, get a decent gun, and maybe a 1v1 or 1v2 battle, not a random fuck fest with 30 people. Wait for event mode to come, it's Deathmatch and you spawn with guns! It's one of the best ways to learn shooting skills aside from just playing\n"}], [{"author": "AllTheRice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/8v60f7/unpopular_opinion_i_enjoy_the_event_pass/", "id": "8v60f7", "selftext": "I feel as if I'm in a very specific circumstance that allows me to enjoy it immensely.

Right now it's really bad for me. I've been behind cover being shot at and then a second or two will go by and I will die instantly. It's unbearable. [This was a game I had last night.. this was after about 3-4 minutes on the ground. It lasted until the 2nd circle appeared.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXQCC4zSRnU) Time for a new crate xD I've noticed this too. It was good right after the patch but it went to shit a week later. Now I die behind corners or behind cover and unloading a whole clip does nothing now because in the death cam you hit them with 1 bullet even though you shot them a billion times and see blood it don't matter because the server says you were dead long ago. Getting atrocious. If blueballs does not make this their main focus this game is done.\n\nSee ya over at Islands of nyne on the 12th, I heard it's much smoother over there.. but I don't have personal experience it just looks better netcode wise. I had a plane teleport multiple times and it wasn't even 1/4th of the way to the end. IS GETTING? It's literally always been unacceptably bad. Sure there have been lulls where it was okay and you felt like it was harder to notice desync, but the game has ALWAYS had bad desync. \n\nThis game is broken beyond Bluehole's ability to fix and I for one will probably limit my game time to maybe 1 match per gaming session. It just feels too bad to have my time wasted by this shit.  I'm done with PUBG until they fix this shit. Not even bluffing. I know the desync is a product of the anti-cheat, (though other factors contribute to it,)  but you can have anti-cheat without this BS if you're a competent developer.  This game is so shit that Star Citizen will be released and have an expansion pack out before it fixes it's bullshit Ever since the new patch when sanhok was released I've been experiencing a lot of dsync. I'm the type of person to jump around and move so everytime I jump, I would say 80&#37; of the time it would be dsync.  One word: \"Superbullets\" i got 1 shot with a lvl 3 helm with a freaking ump, 6 or more shots condensed into 1. I feel as if the people saying it isn't bad just don't watch kill Cam.  I know kill cam is bad for crosshair placement and so on but when on my screen a person runs around a corner already shooting and I instadie on my end, but watch the killcam and the guy turning the corner actually just saw me sitting there staring at him because it had desynced so badly. Don't worry, update #17 will do absolutely nothing about it\n\nand you'll keep playing anyway I quit, it's not fun anymore I swear if PUBG can't fix this shit, it will die out before it releases the Winter Map. All I want from this game is to just be able to play in a lobby of only North American players. I mean I seriously think right now 50% of my deaths are from asian players. And those kills NEVER seem legit. I'm not even saying that they aren't legit kills. On their screen I'm sure it was quite fair. But desync makes you feel like you got screwed even if you didn't. Same here! Every second match I try hard and play like a sneaky bitch, I get rekt in a split second. Playing tpp only and everyone has the shining. Funny how you mention people turning around and headshot. Exacly whats happening to me lately. Cant camp corners because people always kill me first although I shoot first. This whole esport idea of pubg makes me both laugh and mad.  Literally unplayable. What's the point of a battle royal game where you have to hide 80% of the game until the servers become playable so it's almost good enough to actually play? Cause sure as shit if you shoot someone in the first few minutes your bullets won't register. 9 days until islands of nyne...9 days...9 days until islands of nyne...\n\n\nThos lag comp/dsync issue is more noticable now than any time I remember. 15 bullets from a ump to get two tapped. \n\nYou made a fortune off of the event pass, make the game pass decent expectations. Yea i hadnt played in a week and start up yesterday and it was just a shit show. Even my friends who seldom complain were aggravated and we all ragequitted.  \nwe need to find a new game though... There's no point in trying to juke anyone anymore upclose early game.  Just all-in them with a peakers advantage or get rekt.  How is anyone supposed to play this game when what they are seeing is VASTLY different from what is happening on their opponents computer, when there is client side hit detection?  \n\nHere's a clip from today where I juke a guy 3 times, yet I take damage each time when I'm well behind cover.  \nhttps://youtu.be/1clZQ-W36Jo\n\n Its getting worse.  This is nothing new.  It happens over time after every major patch.  Which means there is a server configuration problem that they wont acknowledge.  But whatever.  Let the cycle repeat. Even the Matchmaking Rating is desynced. Leaderboards are possibly scrambled. its very bad lately :/ This game is fucking broken. [Just look at this shit and tell me it's in a good state](https://imgur.com/a/TwCWKcQ) crate will fix the desync tbh! Beyond the whole, getting-shot-while-in-cover issues the desync is causing, I have been noticing WAY more people rubber-banding around while they run...makes it really difficult to shoot somebody who jumps 2 steps forward every half step and then snaps back. I don't know what happened or if anything actually did, but it had been about a week and a half since I played and I got on today because I had time and the game now runs considerably worse. Was so bummed I just got off.  Yes, it\u2019s pretty bad right now. Not the worst it\u2019s ever been, but still terrible. Desync accounts for way more of my deaths than it should.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not only the fact that it\u2019s particularly bad right now, it\u2019s that desync has never seen consistent improvement. People are getting fed up dealing with this crap So \u0131 play comp pubg and \u0131 rarely play safe Matchmaking game's always hotdrop and generaly survive (RNG gods) but for 2 days it's impossiable atleast died more then 20 times behind a wall or a cover not cool First time since I started playing PUBG that I am taking a break from it, because on EU it's pretty much unplayable atm, yes. They bought more servers for the update. Then they slower removed servers each day since in order to save money. Im desperate for another game right now. \n\nI mean a BR game is frustrating by itself as you only have 1 life but last days is unplayable. \n\nPlane is rubberbanding every god damn round I play and looting is a shore because I miss doorframes, stairs and whatnot. \n\nEngaging at distance is very hard because pther players rubberband and teleport so unless you got a SR or a SKS/FAL you can forget about distance fighting. \n\nI love this game but this game is also making me feel terrible. Im getting so frustrated and angry that I take it with me to \u201deveryday life\u201d.  Not just that, game is also lagging as hell I got a jump on a guy, started spraying fully kitted M416 at around 15-20m. he just casually aims at my head and double taps me with M16. \n\nin another game duo approaches compound we are holding, but they stop at the side we didn't expect and they barely manage to enter a building. as I am going around looking for an angle, dude vaults like on top of me. then he shots me with a shotgun while vaulting. \n\nnetwork wise PUBG went to a shithole compared to what it was in EA. I can't fucking wait for Mavericks to hit closed beta. I am tired of this nonsense game Desync is out of control  Playing on EU servers via vpn from Russia and i cant feel the desync.\n\nP.S. about vpn. (our government blocked PUBG server IPs, because telegram recently became illegal in our country. Now im thinking that blue hole have some connections with government of Russia). It'll take years, if ever, for them to fix netcode. They haven't even managed to make the plane look smooth.\n\nIt's flying in a straight line, at a static speed! I haven't even tried playing in the past few days. A month ago if I got should through a wall I'd write it off as a cheater and get on with it. Now it's every fucking time. I've had good games cut short by getting shot through a cover a solid 3 seconds after I'm behind it, and I've had people poke out from cover and shoot me but I didn't see them do it, and thus had no chance to move or shoot back. I'm sure I've done the same thing to other people too, without knowing what it looked like on their end. This game is in a pretty sad state right now. It's even worse if a lag is present. Like if I can't find solo fpp in oceania I try to play in SEA or AS and the desync there is so much worse than if i play in my own server. It's nuts! Yes, today is very bad day.... I have not experienced this before but most of people are just teleporting when running... I'm just waiting on Battlefield's royale mode at this point honestly. Love the game, never complained, cant take the desynch anymore though. Literally unplayable. Island of nyne, mavericks, fear the wolves, bfv, cod blackout, ring of elysium...sorry pubg but these few games listed above and a lot more coming up are going to destroy you  The amount of times I've been downed when I'm 3 paces around a corner is frustrating..when your killer has to walk a few feet around a wall to finish you is just icing on the cake i just drive cars around, trying to run ppl over.  then i quit 2 games later. The game was good for a few days .... because nobody was playing it ...\n\nNow after a lot of people talk about how good the patch was people (like me) are coming back .... and servers can't still handle it as fucking usual.\n\nMostly unplayable for me and my squad right now, today was horrendous, like really horrendous.\n\nDesync is and will be out of hand for ever on Pubg. I had a level 3 vest from crate,but someone managed to kill me with 2 bodyshots on huge range with a scar. My vest was clean! Tf I'm making a strong break until they do something about it.   \n\n\nToo scary for my KDA right now xD People still play this broken garbage game?  LOL mind=blown HOT TAKE Hopefully now that Sanhok is out that they will be working hard on stuff like this.  It seems to be pretty bad really from the videos I've been seeing here. It's something related to the NA/EU servers because in SA I personally haven't been experiencing this. Dude I\u2019ve gone down from like a 2.7 kdr to a 2.1 (over 150 games or so, which shows how much I\u2019ve been dying), in the last two days. I just can\u2019t win any short range fight, especially early game, because of the desync. I start shooting first, hit them more, then inexplicably die. It\u2019s legitimately depressing  You can kill them because China number 1 lmao  i have no idea what you are talking about. maybe hit your shots? Literally only on Sanhok for me lol thought you were talking aboit the youtuber All fine for me...  It will never be fixed.  I wish I could do that. Swear I do. But will be very easy to do if it's still this way when Mavericks beta starts in a few weeks. Alright bye I had two incidents yesterday where I heard someone outside my building, aimed at the window waiting for him to appear, then I'm dead without anyone ever appearing in that window.  Watch replay, he walks to the window, sees me, shoots me, no problem.  It's like he was in a different server, he never appeared on my screen but he saw me and got the kill.  How can two players see such totally different things like that?  What a buggy mess. props to you for keeping your cool, I would of just rage quit. I had this happen for between 4-7 minutes a few days back on Mirimar. This exact same experience, but in la hacienda and it only started happening around 35~ alive and lasted until 26~ alive > Islands of nyne\n\nThank you for the info. Looks like what PUBG should've been at its full release. It even has its own shooting range!\n\nSee ya on the Nyne Funny to find so much info for promising new games in the PUBG sub, thanks a lot added this to my return from vacation bucket list\n\n\nAny other promising game I might have missed? > multiple times and it wasn't even 1/4th of the way to the end.\n\nOur whole squad was just looking and laughing at the plane teleporting CONSTANTLY back and forward. Everyone saw it. No man you are toxic, don't you know.  Toxic. /s Yup. I quit too. I really just keep checking this subreddit to see if shit's been fixed but that'll never happen, I need to just quit thinking it'll get better and wait for a game that actually works to come out.  Yuuuuup. I\u2019m probably done with this game until it\u2019s fixed as well.... There\u2019s a really good chance it\u2019ll never be fixed based off of Blue Balls\u2019 track record. It\u2019s really annoying putting 8 shots into someone\u2019s chest and they hit you twice on your screeen, but death cam shows the complete opposite... and of course, when you round a corner and are easily 3 feet past it already and still die to a bullet that had no way possible way to hit you.... but again, on their screen you\u2019re still there.. Dumb.\n\nThis game has so much potential and could still have a ton of people happily playing and spending money on it if they could just fix issues that should\u2019ve been dealt with a long time ago..... And what\u2019s sad is this game isn\u2019t even early access anymore and hasn\u2019t been \u201creleased\u201d for over half a year.. Wtf, blue balls..? Why are you bringing up anticheat out of nowhere?\n\nThe game is using the same anticheat as it did when things were fine. \n\n>I know the desync is a product of the anti-cheat\n\nNo, you do not. Many performance-related issues are a product of the anticheat but the desync is not one of them.   fortnite has great anti cheat and like next to zero fucking desync its brilliant  goodbye, we will miss you Well, they don't care if you don't play. You don't sound like the kind of person who buys cosmetic items anyway, and they already have your $30. Bye Bye You had me at released Hey, as long as it's released, I'm happy. I still don't get what the game is.  Is it like eve online?  Control sectors of space, collect resources, fight battles, etc..?  What's the long end game in it? super bullet AK, kills me with a level 3 chest, 2 shots in the chest\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9DPGBXbiPs&feature=youtu.be Is this actually a hack? Never heard of it before but there's been a couple times over this past weekend where I've been kitted and felt like I shouldn't have died so fast.  The people who say it's not bad are not playing with high ping players. I have a pretty good connection myself, 5 ping in CS and 15-30 in most games, not 100% sure about PUBG though. \n\nWhen I play solos or with other people with good connections I rarely have any bullshit moments but whenever I play with a certain friend who uses his phone's 4G connection with 250 ping I run into problems caused by desync much more often. I think it's because of the ping based matchmaking. You were right. I hear more EU players on NA servers than I do asians.     Stop punishing the NA players for your terrible geo pool that you don't like, EU. 1000 player battle Royale and you don't think th lag will be worse? You sweet summer child:::  People still take their time to come and comment on reddit post related to a game they won't play, LOL Too bad they're busy working on new crates and skins k Lol 16 salty downvotes. sad but true lol people are still hyped about mavericks after the shit we've seen on E3 You in 6 months: \"bawww the queue times are terrible why is no one playing the game anymore\" Bye have its see you under the dome btw ;) just so your with the lingo before the game comes into EA haha Mavericks proving grounds - Apparently a beta is starting in a few weeks for people that have become a founder, I personally am not buying into it until I see some more game play. I check periodically too. I want it to get better, genuinely. But this is infuriating. Hackers only ruined a few games for me. This desync ruins every game. \n\nCan't believe I'm saying it, but I prefer hackers. Islands of nyne comes out real soon Bye Okay bye Anti cheat causes the desync. I want a realistic BR and not that hitscan shit.  hit scan weapons means \"zero brilliance\", basically you are playing a game with 20 years old technology Just reinforces they're a shit company then :( \"yeah get out of here! More feces for me to consume!\" Basically it is aiming to be everything. Space fighting, FPS, economy, raiding, pvp, exploration, piracy, smuggling...you name it and SC is aiming for it. \n\nAlso the most massive universe ever and no loading screens.  even tho from 100% hp it should take 5 shots if you are at 100%. I feel ya i'v died so many times with lvl 3 vest and lvl 2 helm from 100% hp, died as soon the other guy fired. + with the delay it's imposible to react :/ It's not a hack it's extremly delayed network spagetti bluehole likes to call their netcode. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiHP0N-jMx8 this video here goes into details but TL:DW is he shoots you server dosen't tell you cause it looses the info and then the servers like ohh look he shot him 10 times, i must deliver all this at once and voila superbullet. From personal experience it can happen in solos while checking to make sure your ping is under 30.  It's really odd, it's almost as if the game just is pulling a dayz and just not syncing up with the server correctly. Think what you like. People who know what they are doing can achieve it I come here to check in every now and then and laugh at morons still upset that the game is broken.  When will they realize it will never be fixed? I don't know why you're being downvoted. I mean I know the people who work on skins and crates aren't part of the dev team to fix desync/server stability but the fact that they are even employing people to create more revenue streams in a game so genuinely broken at a very fundamental level is mind-boggling. What exact shit did you see besides some prealpha footage? Have you ever seen what PUBG's alpha footage looked like lol?  I\u2019ve seen some gameplay and I\u2019m not gonna buy into that whole TPP even when aiming stuff With hackers at least you know why you died. With desync you have no idea if you won/lost because you're better/worse or if the server just decided who was going to come out on top. > Islands of nyne\n\nDo you know of any realistic BR games coming out? That looks like a futuristic jumping shooter. No. It. Does. Not.\n\nThe. Game. Is. Using. The. Same. Anticheat. As. It. Did. When. Things. Were. Fine.\n\n-\n\nDid you make this shit up yourself or did someone else misinform you? If the latter: Who?\n \n Play sniper only lul. jk i know what you mean I was on the same boat but the game is just more fun because it is working properly...I'm actually sad to admit it. I loved PUBG :( muh realizms  It's not very motivating that one of their largest online communities does nothing but whine about the state of the game\n\nI don't know, it's just kinda gay. This subreddit is an echo chamber. Why are you even wasting your time on this sub if you're not playing? Surely the dozen people who show up in every comment thread to announce that they're not going to play until the game is \"fixed\" only check this sub once a week or so just to see how things are going, right?\n\nThere's barely an inkling of positivity here I just tried 3.2.  Got stuck in the floor/wall twice in 20 minutes.  I really hope they don't release before they're ready.  Also, it was having some major issues with frame rate at times and I'm on a beast rig.  Do you know what their timetable is? But they're an unproven dev who probably doesn't know what they're doing. If Epic games has lag in Fornite still and they're a triple AAA developer I don't know what hope Mavericks has.  When PUBG are having performance issues with 100 people in the server, what on earth makes you think Mavericks ever gonna run smooth with 1000 and a map twice the size? Good luck mate.  You mean hip fire? I don't think I've seen third person on this game unless I am wrong. The e3 trailer was first person but they went 3rd person for a cinematic view. Can someone confirm?\n\nBelieve me man.. I am right there with you, I hate third person BR, it's just too campy and does not feel skillful having to hide everywhere. Exactly, and I'd add that you also don't know if you lost to desync or a hack. They look about the same most of the time. it looks and appears futuristic, but all of the gunplay is traditional, and theres no mega jumps or boosts like they started to put into cod Yes it does. Realism doesn't worry me. Hitscan, bloom, unrealistic gun mechanics, building insta shields and 3rd person bother me. If they removed all that shit I would play fortnite. Or at least they made a mode that had that removed. Make a shit product and expect the masses to complain, as they should.  I don\u2019t actively play it. Just follow the news. Best not to even think of a timetable. Going to be a while yet.  > But they're an unproven dev\n\nand you're already write them off. they do closed beta in August. \n\nthey said they can. there is no reason to not believe them until we tried.\n\nas for FN and PUBG, they both run on UE. Mavericks don't use UE, they use CRYENGINE. they integrated SpatialOS, which meshes together bunch of servers, which should easily keep up with 400 people on a single map. \n\nwe just have to wait another month or so till closed beta and we will find out whether they can or can not well, Mavericks its not made by a greedy mobile games company like Blueballs. Because they tailor-made their engine for this use-case. Planetside 2 runs perfectly fine with hundreds and hundreds of infantry and vehicles on-screen, because the engine is tailor-made for that game. Ok so you don't know what you are talking about and you get upvotes, that shows how stupid most people on this sub are, I'm still amazed after nearly 2 years it's crazy.\n\nGoogle \"Spatial OS\" then next time make research on the subject you are talking, friendly advice. Did you make this shit up yourself or did someone else misinform you? If the latter: Who?\n\n well, the instant shields would just be equivalent to clothing in pubg.  \n  \ni personally just dislike the map, the need to build in every encounter and the close range jumping. Trust me I will try it and I hope they succeed. I'm just not holding hope so I'm not disappointed.  I don't know what planetside 2 you played but it had very bad desync.  The devs. Are you a le super techy video game developer with a pirated copy of RPG maker? Lmao Absolutely nowhere near as bad as PUBG has been for it's ENTIRE life-span. >The devs\n\nNo they didn't. They may be considered incompetent when compared to the developers of similarly popular games but they aren't dumb *and* dishonest enough to lie about something like that. Prove it. \n\nYou're clearly confusing the **fps issues**, which are indeed significantly worsened by the virtualization aspect of the anticheat measures in particular, with the **desync issue**. \n\nThey are two distinct and separate issues and the desync issue is simply not caused by the anticheat measures. \n\n>Are you a le super techy video game developer with a pirated copy of RPG maker? Lmao\n\nAre you le fucking retarded? le mao xDDDDD\n\nAnyway, congratulations on lying to a bunch of people. I can rest easy knowing that anyone who isn't le fucking retarded can read my comment(s) and see that you don't know anything and are wrong.   Well yeah you're right about that, but don't pretend ps2 was some holy grail of massive multiplayer net code. Mavericks is interesting to me cause of spacial os but i have my extreme doubts. when i first heard about mavericks a year ago the player count was targeted at 400 right? then at e3 i heard 1000 for the first time. I just am not holding my breath for it. If anything it seems like a proof of concept idea to sell spacial os.  Tl;dr TL;DR: Congratulations on lying to a bunch of people. If you're an honest person you'll edit out the lies in your comment to avoid lying to more people--but I strongly doubt you are an honest person so why am I even typing this. Fixed!

The event modes really have been pretty unforgivably bad from start to finish. It seems so strange that they cannot seem to put together a good idea for an event when people have been running custom games for over a year coming up with things to do with subs and what not. Have they figured out how to restrict weapons for a custom game yet? They added a custom armored UAZ in the one mode right?

I really like him but I think it's a bit hypocritical. What\u2019s with the chat saying he called out shroud? Did I miss something?  Yeah, I found an mk14 with a 15x in the event mode yesterday. Easiest 5 kills in a row in my life.  > some money.\n\nLots. Like, he propably doesn't know how much yet. But gotta admit, even though having that skin in, hes still bashing it and for a good reason. Agreed He bent over plenty until the skin deal expired. The level of fanboyism people on here have for the Two Timer is incredible. The first one was super fun. \n\nOr whichever the 8 man squad one was.  That was genuinely fun. The K9 one was pretty much the only good one- training them snipe shots. Tequila Sunrise was pretty awesome I actually enjoyed the Ghillie and Crossbow one, if only because it was such a change of pace from normal gameplay.\n\nI reckon a modified version of the Kar98k could be good with rules like: Much larger circle, fewer players, no pistols, limited respawns, Circle closes very slowly over time and dying to circle prevents respawning. My whole server loves the deathmatch events. 8 man squads with flare guns would be amazing. So articulate, and such forceful logic behind the persuasive language, truly the poster boy for Reddit intellect. arc* 50v50.  Two planes.  Same flight path going opposite directions.  (who cares if they no clip) They half ass money grabs, too. Most skins look like they were designed in a fifth-grade art class and the event pass has been broke as fuck. Is he really 6'8? Disrespect sent shroud an invite to play, shroud pretended he didn't see it after declining because he didn't want to play. Fans got cross, both streamers shrugged with indifference. He wanted to duo with him  huh? why even mention it?  Hes running a show. It's for the audience and their entertainment. People still think Alex the DJ exists, even though doc himself is doing all the work while streaming.  not sure if you are satirising the docs satire. You are either a comedy genius or so out of touch it's unreal. No, this event mode is actually really poorly done.\n\nMost of them are incredibly unbalanced. They don't know how to make these fun because the devs themselves are so poor at the game they can't even choose good the proper attachments and keep them balanced.\n\nGive me a fucking spreadsheet, I will give you settings that are not only balanced but far more enjoyable than any of the events they've done so far, because honestly, they haven't gotten a *single* one right yet.  This dude one 1 v your entire squad 30 times in a row. Sit down waambulance rider  News flash, there are gamers in this sub Ehhh at the beginning it was really good and it was playing smooth but now the servers are laggy af again.  I also think another streamer told him to shut up already about his skin xD\n\nDon\u2019t if anyone got that clipped it was very funny to see Lmao you guys are a joke. \n\nShroud shits on the game *constantly* when it\u2019s deserved. The patch he was talking about legitimately did feel great the first few days. Take off your tinfoil hat.  Man I've never had severe performance or technical issues with this game, so I don't understand why someone having a good experience with something you don't have a good experience with is evidence of anything. \n\nLike I understand a lot of people do have issues, but that doesn't instantly make the game complete shit or worthy of constant criticism. He's said positive and negative things about the game.  No it wasn't, when sanhok hit the game was fucking incredible.\n\nInstant looting, perfect (as good as pubg can be anyways) hitreg and no desync.\n\nIt was like I was playing a completely different game.....\n\nThen 2 weeks later it was back to normal, then worse........ I disagree man. The patch was insane the night it came out. \n\nThere was no desync. My PC was running the game on constant 144FPS. I actually texted my friend to leave his PC on to download it.\n\nSomeone wrote it is because not everyone has downloaded the patch for it. It was a sad truth that came to fruition. I think once everyone is playing, the servers took a shit.  That was before the last 2 amazing patches. shroud complained about the game the last few days Shroud didn't want to play with Doc so he pretended that he didn't get Doc's message and chat got mad. Shroud even said he doesnt believe the number he got from bluehole is actually real until he sees it in his bankaccount\n\nif someone who is making as much money as shroud says they dont believe how much money they made it must be A LOT shroud knows how much he sold. im guessing doc would too. he doesnt even go over the top here. Like teh doc loves taking it a couple notches too far for comedica effect, but if anything, calling them dumb is really going quite easy on them.\n\nBluehole deserve worse criticism for an event that is a desync and nasty rego fucking shit fest, the worst yet imo. Its exactly what they want from him. nothing wrong with liking him -or shroud- while not giving bluehole any more money, the real problem is all these ppl that keep throwing money at bluehole, meanwhile the game is getting worse... be it from event passes, skins, keys, whatever, speak with your wallets... I liked the 10 man 3 team Kar98 + Ghillie Suit\n\nReally enjoyed that. Would've been better without pistols though. :/ Definitely my favourite so far Hes correct though. I dont know how many event modes there have been (7?) but all but the squads one have been really idiotic. Frames are low and there is just no point in fighting in a small circle. If its a teammode, one team can dominate and take over the higher ground. You cant parachute in because about the time you parachute down, you're already dead. Random weapons? I mean c'mon, let us CHOOSE what we use!\n\nIf these event mode ever become interesting, they will be having some sort of mission instead of this deathmatch bullshit with some drop of weapons. I\u2019m voicing my opinion? \n\n\nIf you have fun with the war mode have at it.\n\n\nDoesn\u2019t stop it from being an extremely lag infested and forced mode.\n\n50 players on cod sized maps isn\u2019t fun it\u2019s not skill based Its RNG trash with horrible spawn mechanics  We fortnite now boys Sure is. Because i see doc playing it and it makes my stomach hurt. Alex produces his stream and YouTube videos... he\u2019s a real person, not a dj but still real. I'm not sure they're capable of spawning you with guns that have preset attachments... hahaha no he won't that is why i smell grease and toxicity I experienced my first game crash last night... Yep, that update was awesome for me. This last update Tho.. I've been rubber banding like crazy.  It's insane how this reddit instantly dethroned Shroud as their king simply because he supported the game after a seemingly good update. All of a sudden he became a fake ass merch selling asshole to this community and it's just so bizarre. >Someone wrote it is because not everyone has downloaded the patch for it. It was a sad truth that came to fruition. I think once everyone is playing, the servers took a shit.\n\nexactly, the reason why doc and shroud thought it was good, is because this is what they do for a living, play the game, so they got the patch as soon as it hits, during that sweet spot where the servers aren't being taxed a lot yet due to ppl not having the patch yet.\n\nIt's like that every -\"big\"- patch btw, it's nothing new. Yep but at this point he already had reached close to the max he could sell. He really toned down his complains since dreamhack austin in order to maximise his skin sales. Not saying he is a bad dude though, many would do the same. It probably can be exhausting playing with someone who is always in character. I mean imagine trying to keep up a conversation with Will Ferrel in character as anchorman or something, it would be tiring trying to think of things to talk about with that character instead of just relaxing, talking to a real person about life. Wait. Why? I\u2019m curious now. Aren\u2019t they buddies? Was it because Shroud was playing some other game? Meh, I don't blame Shroud.  I hate it when I have cheaters on my team too. I can imagine, thats why i said lots. Most likely hundreds of thousands dollars. I heard shroud ask Doc about skin sales and Doc said something like 'I just let people handle it', and it sounded like he genuinely didn't know anything about the amount sold.  same, i dont understand why there isnt a permanent 10man mode in. That would have kept me and my mates playing it for at least a few months despite if its a shit fest. Or at least some consistency. Why am I given a r1 revolver and the enemy is giving a g17, like what?  Agreed! When it wasn't bugged at the beginning with no meds and no shotgun attachments it was a ton of fun. He is entitled to his opinion, but he isn't correct because you agree with him.  I've enjoyed all the event modes except perhaps the one with the crossbow, but that doesn't make me right and him wrong, we just have different opinions.  Some people like NASCAR, some like Formula 1, it isn't a right-wrong situation. It\u2019s still a good idea even if Fortnite did it first. he plays many many games - what the utter fuck.  You're delusional and just cant see through the show. Doc himself plays all the music, does everything on his stream. You can clearly see him controlling stuff at times. He shouts to alex, \"put some music on\" and by watching his glasses, he has a control board for those that he then snaps and bam, stuff happens. You propably even think his chair is automated somehow? He turns it with his legs and toes himself.\n\nYou never see Alex on stream, you never see him mirroring from docs glasses even if he \"follows\" the guy with his view. [This guy](https://twitter.com/ThePeacePigeon) does all the video works for youtube even though it says \"Alex\".\n\nThats Docs production team and this is fact.\n\nEDIT\n\n[This is his control screen](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DEQw_sFUAAAtAN3.jpg:large) for all the transitions and whatnot. There was also a panorama view on some of his streams about his desk and the room hes in. No Alex, or desk there either. They make the game dude... its not like theyre just using the same old slide bars as a custom server. they did so in the ghilie sniper event They are. Otherwise optics(holo, 2x,8x) would not be there either. Everyone gets spun by the pubg time machine lol.  I've had very *veeery* few technical issues with this game, so I can definitely see how someone who's had my experience with the game genuinely would think that it's awesome and runs well.\n\nI've had more crashes on Fortnite than I have with PUBG and I got PUBG basically day 1 and I just started playing Fortnite like a month or so ago.  I mean, the patch was insane at the start and I felt he thoroughly enjoyed the game again shortly after the patch\n\nthen it went to shit and he started complaining again How many layers is your tinfoil hat?\n\nHow does shrouds skins selling correlate with how much he is complaining about the game? Sometimes people want to do stuff on their own, who cares  Shroud was like 7 hrs into his stream and was getting off soon.  yikes Good joke. Sensitive crowd apparently though. Similar attitude is what keeos Chris Brown famous, people sweep their idols indescretions under the rug. Oof  Uhunh, sure. No way he could just ask \"people\", no way he would ask about it before. I'm guessing he's smart enough to know that people might not appreciate the answer if he's been complaining about the state of the game for so long but still decided to partner with Bluehole.  I think thats fair. A little bit of randomness is needed to make the game interesting as long as its not a huge deal breaker. i'm sure they are all nice and stuff, but fortShite is not. Since you're having a difficult time connecting the dots, let me help guide you through it:\n\n- If Shroud minimizes his complaints about the game and subsequently praises it on occasion, people have a better perception of it... which leads to\n\n- More people playing PUBG, or being encouraged to try it, or continue playing it... which leads to\n\n- Those players amenable to making in-game purchases being more inclined to do so... which leads to\n\n- Those players liking the aesthetics of Shroud's skins, or who'd like to \"encourage\" him by making a purchase of Shroud's skins, doing so... which leads to\n\n- Shroud making more money.\n\nIt's not exactly complicated to understand, bruh. He's manipulating your perception of the game's quality to encourage purchases of skins he gets a percentage of... I know Doc probably shrugged at it too Chris Brown is only relevant still because he\u2019s a woman beater I think complaining is part of his character. He's probably not as big of a penny pincher as shroud. Hashtag Merch. You can complain about a game and still enjoy the game....and want it to get better.\n\nWhy would complaining about wanting the game to be better preclude you from partnering? He was a 1000 viewer streamer before PUBG. Then why would people play it?  Maybe it's just not for you. Are you 13?? And now give me the source on how many players that during shrouds \"reduced\" complaining boosted his skin sales?\n\nYou guys are grasping at straws very much, and I doubt shrouds _COMPLAINING_ is the deciding factor in how many skins he sells, rather than people wanting a cool skin and shroud/pubg's marketing of those skins. These are tried-and-true methods to increase sales, and yes perceptions are important. \n\nThese are not straws people are grasping at... My biggest question is, do you honestly think people are flocking to buy shroud / doc skins just because they stop complaining about the game for a short duration? \nOr are the buyers of the skins such fools that are easily parted with their money? And are they not players that have their own experience and knowledge about the game and its bugs and flaws?\n\nAlso still want to see a source.

They should play like me, taking a minute lining up a perfect headshot, because that is skill!\n\nPistols at 20 paces! Take cover, peak, and shoot.\nDon\u2019t get shot at first.\nGit gud etc.\nAim punch is good. OP please post your op.gg stats, the community as a whole would love a good laugh. Not to mention aim punch is relatively low when it's limb and even chest damage. Aim punch to the head though is brutal, as it should be. If it prevents you from being able to return fire remotely accurately, yes.\nA player who shoots first and hits legs and arms will render a better player unable to line a up a headshot and take out his opponent. There should be no aimpunch whatsoever. Give me one reason aimpunch should be in the game apart from \"It's realistic\" That is false.  You just have to work harder at it and react quick enough to shoot once your crosshairs are on it.  Aimpunch should be in PUBG for several reasons.  Most of which are outlined in the above threads. Snipers would be over powered without it. If you come across someone with a bolt action sniper, you literally have no chance of winning a peek war assuming the guy knows how to shoot. The only way to beat a good sniper is to peek quicker and land your shots to the head before he has a chance to pull the trigger. Only then can you break his aim and force his shot to go high. If you remove aim punch, there is absolutely nothing stopping high powered snipers from running through everything they come across in a 1v1 peek war. Name the several reasons. Only one was cited and it does not convince me. In theory your argument makes sense, but in practice, when you look at any other shooter that doesn't have aimpunch, bolt action snipers aren't overpowered. Look at CS:GO and Battlefield.\nEdit: Rainbow 6 Siege is another good example, all weapons 1 shot headshot and there is no aimpunch yet you can still win a peak battle. Without aimpunch, anyone can just run around with a bolt action rifle, start to get sprayed at (maybe \\~35m+) and will just turn and line up a headshot because theres no way that in the time it takes for you to line up your headshot that someone else can spray you down at that distance with the accuracy in this game.  Thus nerfing pretty much any AR that isn't viable as a tapping rifle.\n\nAlso, this game goes for hyper realism.  That is probably the sole thing in this game that makes it different than any other game out there in this genre.  Aim punch is just an extention on that.  If you were truly getting shot and taken damage there would be very little chance for you to be able to return fire accurately.  Which makes sense in the video game.\n\nAnother reason why the aim punch should be in the game is that it isn't as severe as you make it out to be.  If you get hit in rapid succession and you were lining up a headshot on someone with a kar98, yeah it will throw your shot off (WHICH IT SHOULD), but 99 times out of 100 when you are engaging someone with an AR, DMR, or SMG where aimpunch is relevant, you will still be able to spray back at them and compensate very easily for the aimpunch.\n\nTo speak to your point that in other shooters that don't have aimpunch and bolt action rifles not being op: The only reasons that in games like CSGO that bolt action rifles aren't as OP as you would think is due to the fact that everyone is full body peaking, including yourself (easier for you to die faster apposed to just your head) and because you are forced into a very close up zoom in a CQB.  In pubg you don't usually fight people within 25m, and at distances greater than 25m, a 4x serves perfectly to line up headshots.  Even running headshots. I have a clip of me in a field. Getting tapped with an sks, I have a kar98 and line up a head shot just as I get aim punch. But because he is dealing with recoil too. I re aim, shoot, take another hit and he dies from a headshot.\nSo it\u2019s not OP.\nAnd you should be rewarded for aiming first, regardless of shot placement.  I'm in agreement.

Yeah it's a bit frustrating and often end up playing SEA until OC peak time.  I don't think the wait timer actually helps, as people just check the queue time and cancel, so you need a larger demand to bring that timer down.  I would prefer that when you queued you actually joined the server and then you can gauge how quickly players are leaving, maybe start the countdown at 70+. Honestly the devs haven't put much effort into this, and I don't see them starting now. They've known queues are not working correctly for months now, but haven't fixed it (Proven easily by queuing and requeuing fix still occurring and issues like event mode being stuck on a 50:00 timer in peak times) and I don't see them fixing it any more as OC players have been driven away and the region is now pretty quiet.\n\nIMO they will just remove OC soon citing low player counts, as they have driven all the OC players away. It's definitely not enough players. Hence why it might? work to have a single queue before peak times. Idc about playing TPP only during the day if it means i can find a game Yeah I agree 100%.

Always using this way to cross the river, always on motorbike and always with backflip.  \nP.S on the highest hill (north-west one) there's also a rock that can be used as ramp, but landing is tough. ;) Let's hope this is still doable on the new slower scooter, was one of my favorite things on this map to backflip this jump.

You have to play ahead of the circle if you don't want to play the bridge/river games.

I've seen shroud and many other players hit this jump...just because there is a clip of choco doing it doesn't mean others haven't also. And they also have this one I mean, there definitely could be. That was just the example which popped into my mind. Plus Just9n reacted like he'd never seen that particular jump done and I know him and Shroud play all the time together.

This is why people will see sub-100% GPU usage but still get bad FPS.  If PUBG were optimized you'd see 90%+ CPU usage in cities with less than 100% GPU usage and you'd be getting high FPS.  Instead, PUBG will only use a portion of your CPU so you have to get an extremely fast one for to put as much of it to use as posible.  When everything is working right you'll see high CPU usage in areas that are CPU demanding and high GPU usage in ares that are GPU demanding and always have high FPS.  Yes you r right because the fps I told in the post was with frame limiter off and GPU at 100%\nBut I do use frame limiter while playing seriously as it reduces input lag Okay, thanks! So which of the two drivers do you actually recommend? Everything very low except textures which is on ultra and FXAA anti aliasing from Nvidia CP Sorry but I don't have much idea about G Sync  Before uninstalling.....fps drop in gunfights is prolly due to CPU bottleneck Are you using windows 10? You have to disconnect your pc from the internet otherwise the operating system automatically downloads the driver. The only game whose fps matters to me ryt now is PUBG . I'll update to latest drivers once battlefield 5 is out Do give it a try but nothing assured as PUBG can be running wrong in ur system for many reasons Seems like a CPU bottleneck problem In safe mode only basic services would be running so ur graphics driver won't be in use so it gets uninstalled properly otherwise it won't be uninstalled competely 391.01 391.01\n Yea but there's still some micro stutters....but u know pubg is gonna be pubg Are you using a 60 hz monitor setup [https://www.blurbusters.com/howto-low-lag-vsync-on/](https://www.blurbusters.com/howto-low-lag-vsync-on/)\n\nLittle bit late to the party, but try this. I see better frametimes in Pubg with vsync on, and with this method you will find a nice middle ground input lag wise if you dont have VRR (like gsync)... Not my problem if ur system is performing suboptimally You want CPU usage to be as low as possible and GPU usage as high as possible. It's simple as that.\n\n> If PUBG were optimized you'd see 90%+ CPU usage in cities with less than 100% GPU usage and you'd be getting high FPS. \n\nThat means the game isn't optimized or the CPU is a bit weak. Even in CPU-heavy areas, you should always aim for 100% GPU usage to get the most out of your graphics card. If you limit your fps, you are increasing your input lagg. I tried 391.01 388.71 and the latest ones with DDU and safe boot and my conclusion is \n391.01>388.71>latest driver Using any sort of sync technology increases input lagg FYI. Sync options off will always have the least input lagg. The driver thing is most likely a placebo, using newest drivers is better 99.99% of the time unless nvidia clearly screws up, which they dont tend do and if they do, its very specfic things that get a hot fix very quickly. Thanks. Whats ur in game settings?\n So you're installing the 391 driver while in safe mode? I've used DDU before in safe mode when I switched from AMD to NVIDIA. I guess I'll try out the 391 drivers. I was just confused, I thought u were talking about lanching PUBG while the PC in safe mode. Yes, I\u2019m your fellow laptop gamer >lier\n\nFraps log or didn't happen mate. Don't fool yourself.\n\n// I'll provide you with one, just to think about your post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/8udnmi/ryzen\\_1800xgtx\\_1080\\_1440p\\_very\\_low\\_preset\\_sanhok/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/8udnmi/ryzen_1800xgtx_1080_1440p_very_low_preset_sanhok/) Nope, that\u2019s wrong. A well optimized game will put both to use if there\u2019s elements in the game that require both. Frostbite engine is a perfect example. When I play Battlefield 1 or Star Wars: Battlefront I\u2019ll get 90% usage on all 8 threads (4790k) and 100% GPU usage (GTX 1080) and I get well over 60FPS on ultra at 1920x1200. I\u2019ll get 45-60FPS on triple wide at 6000x1200 with the graphics set to \u201chigh\u201d which is fantastic.\n\nThere are games that don\u2019t have many elements that are demanding on the CPU and yeah, in those cases low CPU usage and high GPU usage is ideal.\n\nA well built game will *make use* of all that expensive hardware you have in your PC. You want high CPU & GPU usage but you don\u2019t want to hit bottlenecks where you\u2019re getting 100% usage but it\u2019s not enough to sustain high FPS. Games like PUBG and DayZ are notorious for this.  Not any more than by leaving the fps unlimited, and having their performance spike from 110 to 60 as a firefight begins, that's a loss of 50 frames the instant a shootout begins. That'll get ya killed\n\n Okay, thank you very much! oh interesting!  I've been on 388.71 for ages because I get micro-stutters with geforce experience recording otherwise.  Is that what you suffered?  Or why do you think 391.01 is better?  Also It's a confirmed fact Nvidia did fuck up UE4 games' performance in their latest drivers Ur ryt but I'm forced to use sync as I have a 60 hz screen which results in horrible screen tearing as my fps is quite high above 60 . \nSo among the sync technologies available for me , fast sync appears to have least input lag for me Everything very low except ultra textures I put it up as a comment....check it out Don't use vsync. >A well optimized game will put both to use if there\u2019s elements in the game that require both.\n\nThis is true.\n\n>When I play Battlefield 1 or Star Wars: Battlefront I\u2019ll get 90% usage  on all 8 threads (4790k) and 100% GPU usage (GTX 1080) and I get well  over 60FPS on ultra at 1920x1200.\n\nThat's what I meant. Even at 90% CPU usage, it's still better than anything higher. You want as much headroom as possible for the CPU (read: as low as possible). 90% is dangerously close to max and any spikes in CPU usage can cause frame drops and stuttering. I'd look into upgrading the CPU if I were you.\n\n>There are games that don\u2019t have many elements that are demanding on the  CPU and yeah, in those cases low CPU usage and high GPU usage is ideal.\n\nThe rule applies to all games. Under no circumstances you'd want your GPU usage to ever go below 100% (unless you're using a frame limiter). Also, it's not about FPS. Here are two situations:\n\n1. GTX 1080 at 85% usage getting 85 FPS\n2. GTX 1070 at 100% usage getting 80 FPS\n\nSituation 2 is preferable since your GPU is being fully utilized. Situation 1 indicates that there is a bottleneck in your system that when rectified, you will get 100 FPS (100% GPU usage). It's about getting the most out of your GPU. Maxed out GPU doesn't cause stutters but maxed out CPU does. What makes you think that drop wouldn't occur if you limit your fps? Np mate.....always happy to help Source? Quick search on google shows nothing about the recent drivers having performance issues on the engine? Sure, but you told [mykhalchevskyy](https://www.reddit.com/user/mykhalchevskyy) that using fast sync reduces input lagg, when it does the opposite. Granted, it isnt a huge increase like vsync, but it still is an increase and he asked what reduces input lagg. What about less demanding games like for instance I don't even think my 1070 goes much above idle temps playing FTL and max usage was somewhere around 30%.\n\n > I'd look into upgrading the CPU if I were you.\n\nHmm.  4790k was one of the top of the line i7 CPUs when it came out.  I'd get 80-90% CPU usage on optimized games like ones on the frostbite engine and have really high FPS, yet really low FPS in CPU heavy areas of games like ArmA 2 and DayZ which are really poorly optimized games.  Yes, more headroom is better, but I'd rather a game actually make use of my CPU and generate high FPS as a result than not be able to use more than 30% of it and be stuck at 30-40FPS as a result.\n\n> The rule applies to all games. Under no circumstances you'd want your GPU usage to ever go below 100% (unless you're using a frame limiter).\n\nI don't know about that.  I've played plenty of games where either a) it's a far less demanding game than my GPU is capable of dealing with or b) I'm in an area that has very few GPU dependent assets and I'll get 40-50% GPU usage but still have 200+FPS.  I'm okay with that.  I'd rather not have my fans screaming and be using up a bunch of electricity if it's not needed to generate an FPS that's much higher than my monitor's refresh rate.\n\nEdit: just to add to this: I tend to play mostly open world games like DayZ/PUBG and there's areas where there's very few elements that require anything out of your GPU.  In DayZ I may be either out in an open field with nothing but dirt and rocks, at the coast looking out across the ocean, or out in an open field looking straight up at the sky.  Even with post processing, AA, etc maxed out at ultra I'm never going to get 100% usage from my GPU in those scenarios, but I'll be getting a much higher FPS than my 144hz monitor is capable of displaying.  Ever run the 3DMark benchmarking tool?  They run several GPU rendering scenarios and then follow it up with a CPU test that is computing physics of a bunch of objects falling and interacting with each other.  The last test is a combination of the CPU and GPU tests.  There are elements in games that are simply not going to be tasked by the GPU.  Calculating certain physics interactions, AI, etc.  It's not as though everything can be pushed from the CPU to the GPU.  If I'm playing DayZ and I'm in a city with lots of zombies and loot items that are being processed by the CPU but no foliage, no trees, very few complex shadows, no smoke, etc, and I was able to get 90% CPU usage while my GTX 1080 is sitting at 50% usage and get 200 FPS I'd be ecstatic (sadly this isn't the case because DayZ is a horribly optimized game).  It's not necessarily about having your GPU at 100% usage the entire time, but rather that the game makes good use of your CPU when it's needed and good use of your GPU when it's needed and that you have a good enough CPU and a good enough GPU to process those things.  If all of those factors are in place you'll get good performance. Then this game is FUBAR\u2019d, because i get stutters with an 8700k.  The idea is to not limit the frames dropping, but limiting how much they drop. If you get drops to 60 and you were at 120, that\u2019s gonna feel horrible. If you limit your frames to 75 or 80, that drop to 60 isn\u2019t going to feel as drastic, and you may even be able to play through it and win that firefight.  Saw it in one of Nvidia discussion forum Idk whether ur trying to annoy me or what but every sync increases input lag of which fast sync has minimal impact . 60hz ppl like me always need to use  v sync to prevent tearing so basically fast sync is a reduction in input lag for me FTL is 2D right? I guess that's an exception. I get what you mean. It's fine if you get a satisfactory frame rate even without 100% usage. I'm just saying that it's not the ideal/perfect situation. If you're saying that it's possible to get 200 FPS with 50% GPU usage, that means the GPU should be able to push 400 FPS with 100% usage without being held back by a slower component. Not all stutters are caused by maxed CPU but a maxed CPU could cause stutters. The game is just not well optimized, I'm sure it'll still stutter with 8700K @ 10 GHz. Considering I can avg 141FPS and have a 1% low of 42, 0.1% low of 28FPS I would have to apply a damn low fps limit and my game would look choppy 100% of the time then.\n\nI would have more consistent, but also generally higher input lag. I'll try it aswell!\nBtw which NVidia Drivers your recommend now? 391.01?\nAlso, could you link me your steam account in private message? True I suppose. I limited mine to 115 on a high end system and it feels decent, though it\u2019s a crying shame that with my hardware I still can\u2019t make use of a 144hz monitor. Seems like the only game that runs buttery on unreal engine is fortnite.

I was hearing a guy running, and is sounded that he was running in front of me. The guy comes from behind my back and has the easiest kill ever, because I always watching the wrong spot. Also, it's impossible to distinguish whether the sound comes from top or a bottom floor of a house. We can hear the footsteps, but it's just a 50/50 guess if he's on the top or the bottom floor.

May or man not only be necessary because of shitty headphones.\n\nEasier to tell if something is left/right than front/behind, so I move my aim to make the sound come from my side. Real easy then. Obviously this is totally useless if there's a dude already on top of you, or the sound is a one off snipe.  I have no problem distinguishing sound. Sometimes footsteps just disappear but when I do hear them I know exactly where they\u2019re coming from. Check your settings. Guess I'm just unlucky with my PUBG game, since no other game I play reproduces sound so badly... Well, I could tell if my earphones were backwards, because they simply don't fit when put properly xD I don't have this issue on any other game.

People are doing things I have only ever seen streamers do. I feel like I am playing against people above my skill level. I feel like I am playing against a bunch of Shrouds.

How do I get better?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/9au2bs/i_suck_how_do_i_get_better/", "gencomments": " I feel like hot dropping can certainly be helpful with improving gunplay, but only if you're already to the point where you're plenty fluid with the controls. Personally, if I haven't played a particular game for a spell I'll have to think about the controls for a bit after returning, and since quick looting/inventory management is important in hot dropping maybe try dropping places where there's nobody else until that fluidity returns. Good luck! Play a different mode besides solos until you get your PUBG legs under you again. It\u2019s a lot easier to get back into rhythm and gain some confidence when the game isn\u2019t the over the second you\u2019ve been outplayed or just died to bad luck. But just always be cognizant of the fact the play style in squads and duos is inherently different than solos strategically speaking and won\u2019t necessarily always translate in certain situations.  Hot dropping for practice is not always the best option. I would recommend going to \"medium-action\" places, i.e. places where a few people consistently land. That will give you the opportunity to actually get a gun and maybe a helmet before engaging into a fight. Landing at the compounds just next to hot drops is also a nice way of doing this. This allows for fights where you actually feel like you have a chance and that will make you better.  I go into the custom games and play a lot of war to practice my shot. I am nowhere near the best but it does help. If you hot drop try to see where people are aiming and go for the buildings more to the outside. If you have not experienced Sanhok before, try sticking to the regular mode instead of mini royale, the new map does throw you off at first so coupled with your downtime it's even worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot sure how long you were out, but server performance improved and some parts became more responsive which proppeled some players to play a lot better due to not being hampered by unresponsive inputs. I know I had lost on many occasions when the weapon simply refused to be picked up even though I was first to the nearest weapon, did the pick up first etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother thing is ammo. Are you picking up all the ammo? In a hot drop essentially what you need to do is in this order:\n\n1. Pick up weapon\n2. Pick up 1 stack of ammo\n3. If weapon has single/burst/auto fire mode change the fire mode to auto\n4. Reload\n5. Kill enemies if any\n6. Pick up remaining ammo\n\nAll this done in rapid succession will be the quickest way to start a fight. There is a training mode coming soon with shooting range. I\u2019m not great at this game and just had to reset my muscle memory having bought a Razer Tartarus over the weekend, so I went from top 1.5% to 20% in two days!\n\nI\u2019m quite new to the game but what helped me with aim and confidence in a fight was the death match event mode which finished yesterday. Look out for these, great practice. I used to be like that too, until I realized that you dont get better at this game by winning, but by losing. Everybody says to \"hotdrop, bro\" but chances are that you're going to be dead before you even get a gun. Do a slow start if you want, but start going to popular places post 5 minutes after the plane disappears (graveyard area on Miramar, pochinki area, etc.). Doing this with full gear, weapons, and at least some meds, it ensures that you will get a good firefight in, and you wont have to waste too much time before you shoot something and win, or die. If you die, do it again! It made me great at this game and I try to tell everybody else about how I learned. I could also tell you about more advanced methods, but only if you want. Best of luck, and happy shooting! If you're being beaten in the parachuting phase, maybe you haven't perfected the S-drop. Same here and after a month I'm finally back or I've dropped to a proper skill level (idk how ranking works or does it even exist, I just play for fun). I don't like hot dropping because the game is so slow to start and sometimes the actual match lasts 20 seconds when waiting the match lasts 60 seconds or more. There are fewer new players. When you pick up loot, do you tap f on it or do you go into inventory and swipe it over ?. its best to do the latter.\n\nYou might be happy with the training mode next month but until then your best bet is to try some war modes. Another alternative is rather than hot dropping, go somewhere far from the action on a solo squad's, find a weapon and try get used to recoil, which is mostly vertical and aim for a spot the same height of a players head, which is what you want to try instinctively aim for. The guy behind you is grabbing and loading guns that you didn't see because they were invisible due to spawn lag on hot drops, and maybe their lag desync whatever is better than yours for some reason which makes them shoot you 30 times before you realize they shot one.  If you've been gone a while the game probably seems a lot worse now, there's new crates to buy and new guns to try, but also some new bugs on top of the old ones.  They have a campaign to \"fix pubg\" in progress, so if you stick around you can experience the improvements live.\n\nHot dropping exacerbates a lot of the glaring server failures they are trying to fix, try some warm drops until you get a handle on what is your fault and what is the game's. Play more... Op you should just wait September. PUBG will bring a new training map 2x2km. You will be better. Just need maybe 10h in practice mod equivalent to 400h hour of normal game  They changed the base rating to 1700, which used to be 1200. Basically means that you are matched with far better players than you used to be matched with. Suck harder. Don\u2019t have that problem. I have the controls down perfectly. I do. I suck equally as bad.  Lol I tried. Still die first time i see someone every time. I know Sanhok. Played it when in released. Could be the ammo thing.  Yeah I played that. Died every time until I got an AWM. I cant control recoil anymore either on guns with automatic fire. I do that and die every time. If it helps I\u2019ve been playing pubg since early access. I know the strats. Its a difference in skill only. How are your shooting skills? Have you worked on your recoil controls? I know a big part that helped me with <30 m sprays was crouching. Another is your leading, with snipers as well, when someone is running, it's something you have to work on a lot. If you want I could try and help you?\nBest of luck!"}], [{"author": "GaryBuseysNut", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/9b473i/test_servers_live_during_maintenance/", "id": "9b473i", "selftext": "Title", "title": "Test servers live during maintenance?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/9b473i/test_servers_live_during_maintenance/", "gencomments": " For some reason, I can't launch test servers.

I hope for actual exercises - runs like you did but times and scores. Able to do with duo/squad would be awesome. Different scenarios, difficulty rated !!  i think u might have ur sensitivity a bit high. turn it out down a bit and it should help make more precise aiming, it helped me get better a ton using that Would be absolutely amazing with just friends or on your own. As it is it's shit, because anything positive about it is ruined by it being full of random people who are firing at targets or you or just shooting into the air. And if you know The Pit, you know yourself. Another thing you can try is to only shoot the middle target and try to do the course faster.\n\nThe middle target is at head's height.  Flashbang, through the door So cute I like to drive fast enough to smash down all the fences around the pit and the actual grenade pit Get used to leaning before and while shooting. GL with your training, young soldier!  No worries, at least you train. Wtg. Wtf that random guy you shot at XD  this should have been a score/time based area like in cod but pubg was too lazy Hahah, yeah I'm kinda bad. I don't have a proper run yet, atm I just stumble around and shoot whatever target I find around the corners.  yeah, overshooting is frequent. \n\nThis is not flaming, I sincerely think finding the right sensitivity will help the OP. You might be right, but I'm already at 400 DPI and 53 sens, if I lower it even more I'm gonna run out of space on my mat. I was hoping to get used to this sensitivity by training here, actually.  Thanks, that's actually helpful  Yeah I'm no Shroud lol accurate xD Thanks for the tip, I always forget!  If you are looking/interested in some free coaching toss me a pm, I have some great material I can send your way!  Ive been told go super high dpi and lower your sensitivity... but I haven\u2019t been able to find someone explain it like wacky could so I have no idea behind what I\u2019ve been told For real? Send away, I'm down for it! Thanks!  DPI is basically how \"fine\" your mouse sensor can detect movements. Higher DPI corresponds to smaller movements being tracked. But since pixels can only get so small the virtual distance tracked increases as well. The in game sensitivity is merely a coefficient of sorts that modifies the distance reported by the OS. This means that a higher DPI with low in game sensitivity will technically be the exact same as a lower DPI with higher sensitivity, with the difference of the fact that the former will track finer movements better. But the counterintuitive notion is that you actually don't want small jitter movements. Let's think of an extreme case - a person with Parkinson's. Their hands are going to continuously shake, therefore inducing the task of keeping a cursor hovering over some object to be literally impossible. However with a lower DPI the shaking might be ignored which results in a steady cursor. I was somewhat half asleep when I wrote this so please excuse my usage of informal terms like \"virtual distance\".\n\nBye and tanks. [deleted] I was watching [this cs go video](https://youtu.be/EplLoJFyTL0) earlier. Basically higher dpi+low in-game sens is smoother vs low dpi+high in-game sens. But higher dpi makes your cursor go crazy when you're out of the game Great explanation, thanks!  Holy crap that's high!\n I use the same mouse as shroud which has a dpi switch. I use one dpi for desktop and one for gaming. My next attempt at the setting with be 1500 per another comment in this thread."}], [{"author": "cyber1gaming", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/9ehoxt/loved_the_even_mode_so_i_made_a_drag_movie/", "id": "9ehoxt", "selftext": "", "title": "Loved the even mode so I made a drag movie", "url": "https://youtu.be/29TWIQweIDA", "gencomments": ""}], [{"author": "Kittenyberk", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/9esdca/how_about_a_physics_bullshit_occured_here_button/", "id": "9esdca", "selftext": "Having had just lost half my health to absolutely nothing and my car stopping, it got me thinking it might be useful to have a function to report the coordinates and anything else useful to bluehole for investigation and perhaps even to fix em.", "title": "How about a \"Physics bullshit occured here\" button?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/9esdca/how_about_a_physics_bullshit_occured_here_button/", "gencomments": " In the meantime, you can just screenshot the location on the map and submit it.

I feel like the thing that always screws me is people getting the drop on me out in the open when Im rotating. I get the idea behind moving cover to cover but I feel I'm always shot at the angle I'm not covered from. Any advice on this? > play like it's H1Z1\n\nremember to stop your vehicle before exiting:p Bob and weave and crouch like a mofo\n\nDon\u2019t do it in a recognizable pattern either, be unpredictable \n\nThat\u2019s only really for long range though, although it\u2019s worth trying with short range as well. You never know!\n\nFor short range you just gotta be good at flicking to people. If you\u2019re out in the open and you get sprayed at you\u2019re probably dead anyway so you might as well go for the kill, no other option right?\n\nAlso practice spraying 56 guns with 3x and 4x, crazy how much of an advantage that zoom gives you. \n\n"}], [{"author": "Kaywhysee", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/9kvyoq/you_know_i_had_to_do_it_to_em_loud/", "id": "9kvyoq", "selftext": "", "title": "you know i had to do it to em (loud)", "url": "https://v.redd.it/oe8mdgmk0vp11", "gencomments": ""}], [{"author": "danzail", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/9l6qsr/oce_bathing_in_tears/", "id": "9l6qsr", "selftext": "Anyone else from OCE got a hard smile on their face with everyone losing their shit over 110ms ?\n\n\n(Ps: no one should have 110 when you can get better, but we got fricken 300+ for 6 months and told to stop crying)\n\n(PPS: it\u2019ll get better as they refine their algorithms)", "title": "OCE bathing in tears", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/9l6qsr/oce_bathing_in_tears/", "gencomments": " \"we want servers on the west coast of America\"\n\nlaughs in Perth As an Australian WoW and PUBG player, the uproar about maintenance times always made me chuckle  obviously its a population issue on their end! 300ms is more than reasonable for their small regions! they should stop complaining I come to this sub to watch highlights not see people complain! /s  Tears of joy now that the OCE queues are popping off. This is a special day for OCE, enjoy it boys Yeah, nah, nah cunts, totally agree with taking a bit of pleasure from it towards the minority who shat on us, but at the same time, we're all here still, cos we enjoy and love this piece of shit, yet unique buggy game.\n\nBut if we want it to regain an uptick in player growth and for the devs to not just pander to the Chinese market, then we **absolutely need** thriving NA & EU markets.\n\nOtherwise we're all fucked. Now watch Blueballs fix the issue within a week. I'm laughing at anyone who talked shit to us when we voiced our issues, but I heavily sympathize with anyone else in the world going through the shit we did, its not fun and I hope a resolution comes soon. Yeah I feel for people... but for months OCE complaints have been met with \u201cDEAD REGION NOBODY CARES STFU\u201d. Now it\u2019s happening elsewhere and it\u2019s the worst thing ever.\n\nMakes it hard to sympathise. I guess but.. it should never have been a problem. Then or now, OCE or anywhere else.  I get 40-50 from Townsville north Queensland.  I am so happy that we get to play on our own servers again.  Great job by PUBG.\n Loving being able to play again, hope they fix the problems with the other regions quickly though. Yes, it is relatively satisfying to think of all the pricks who came into our threads where we were pleading for help since April and saying \"you guy complain so much it's ridiculous, get a better population etcetc\" are now experiencing even just a little bit of the frustration\n\n\nAt the same time I feel bad for those who were sympathetic.\n\n\nUltimately we all deserve a better game.  got a half chub mate I have a shit eating grin right now. All the yanks complaining about latency, match making etc.. when they literally told our entire region to STFU and deal with it. HA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOCE last night was the most fun in PUBG I've had in 1600 hrs. Aussies screaming, being nice to each other etc.. let's hope we continue this trend.  The tears are so fucking delicious.\n I was getting 200+ ping today in Canada... saw all the threads and too excited.. but all i get are sanhok games :(  Seriously though... 1 day and they've already released a patch to fix American queues? Fuck you Bluehole. I'm loving it.  \n\n\n \\- sorry, but so many people pretty much posted \"It's your population\" when we all knew the servers were working fine up until a patch (I think update 19?) a few months ago, which absolutely SLAMMED OC servers overnight.  \n\n\nSo after playing for months with 250 ping without complaint, hearing people whinge about 80-120 ping is absolutely hilarious. Yeah very much so lol I'm seeing this complaint a lot. What is OCE? It will be fixed for their servers ASAP, so after living with 200+ ping for about 6 months, and pretty much being told to STFU and hearing nothing from the devs, I don't feel even the slightest bit of sympathy for the people complaing about 130.  Not everybody by a long shot man.  Super happy for you guys, but also sad because they fucked things up for the rest of the world not OC, sea or AS [removed] If they don't fix this soon the game is dead. I uninstalled because of this update Big ping in this game is advantage it still takes me awhile to find a game... i rather play on the old insta queue SEA servers lmfao >PPS: it\u2019ll get better as they refine their algorithms\n\nAll this post tells me, and this point specifically, is that OCE is full of a bunch of absolute idiots who will bend over and take it no matter what. I haven't had to deal with this for more than 24 hours, and I'm ready to stop playing the game until it gets fixed. Yet there was a brigade of you, on this sub every fucking day complaining about how you couldn't play the game on your servers, and yet you kept coming back every fucking day, suffering through shitty connections on servers outside your region. \n\nYou're all fucking retarded for sticking around, and believing in this game if this is how you were treated.  Fuck what ms do you get in perth. Probably the most awkward location on earth in terms of gaming hahaha. Mmaatteeee the feels 11/10 can relate Yeah some downtime during peak hours in a game that requires no specific login time, vs our WoW experience where Tuesday is a write-off and Wednesday usually has a mid raid server reset.\n\n#JustOCEThings Damn it's great to be an European.  >sypathsize\n\nFake aussie detected. I don't understand tbh, ofc there are assholes that were saying that, but not everyone. A lot of us  upvoted/commented your posts.  \nAlso most of the bad comments on those type of post were downvoted. Makes it easy as fuck to laugh though  You act like no one outside OCE supported you guys with this issue\ud83d\ude02 OCE complains posts have never been downvoted or anything from what I know, people were also supportive in the comments... But I suppose the OCE community felt totally left alone by PUBG Corp but also the rest community because we kept playing?! What did you expect? The whole community to stop playing until you got your servers/MMR wroking as intended?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfrica and Middle-East are still totally abandonned, but since that's just the usual shit in the gaming industry, no-one cares (community or BH) and probably nothing will be done (at least for a while). So don't feel too bad OCE, people cared and you were not forgotten. You can still sympathise towards those that really are forgotten (I agree that sympathisng for those whining about 100ms ping isn't necessary, princesses don't need more sympathy).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Anyways, enjoy the game now that you can! That's what matters after all. It's not really \"Great job\". \n\nThey've literally done nothing to fix the inherent issue.\n\nThe only reason why it's fixed is because we've all been forced to play in our own region. If matchmaking wasnt fucked we never would have left Duuude....I was so happy as well...hipefully it lasts Is it working right now for you? I'm now always getting put onto 200ms+ servers. OCE means oceanic. It's us, the Aussies :). Basically, bluehole broke the matchmaking for us and then didn't fix it for 3 months (till now) and barely communicated with us during this time. When OCE players complained, there were lots of comments about how we didn't have a player base to support matches, we were irrelevant, we could just play on SEA servers and get 250-300 and shouldn't complain, and other more nasty commentary. There were of course nice comments and support but it's the typically the nasty ones that stick out.  Yeah pretty much. \"Qqqq this 100-150 ping is so unplayable!\" Meanwhile im sitting here going \"Bitch Ive had wins on more than double that, and been forced to deal with it for 6 months\" We were told to move on, shut up, and a bunch of other mean shit. When the shoe is on the other foot, you suddenly expect righteous behavior? Fuck you and your values you hypocritical cunt. Love. OCE You being downvoted just shows how fucking stupid the videogame community is. Mate - in my opinion it\u2019s less about grinning at everyone having an issue - and more about grinning that the issue has escalated and has more attention on it. \n\nIm sure we are all thankful for every upvote we got - and the issue isn\u2019t directed at you specifically. However there were also a large number of people who couldn\u2019t have cared less as our small region copped it - but life\u2019s good for them because we don\u2019t mean much in the scheme of things. \n\nNow that this is having a larger impact - it might mean the larger issue is taken more seriously and might be resolved for everyone. Including us aussies. \n\nLot of mights in there too. Based on our history - I would say this could be going on for a while.  In a tiny fraction of cases, maybe. But in a heads-up fight, the low pinger's shots are recognized by the server first. Ah, the cry of the perennial low pinger who needs an excuse.\n\nIt\u2019s like saying coming from poverty is an advantage cos scholarships.\n\nHot take: it\u2019s never an advantage. Cool story brah Yer garn mate pull the other one look at this yank drongo spitting yarn Righto cobber, let's see you give a fair dinkum crack at leaving this game. We finally get a fair shake of the sauce bottle and here you are acting like doing a harold holt is a piece of piss. Tosser I get around 100ms if every other device that consumes internet is turned off in the house, otherwise around 300-400 Cheap flights to Asia though LOL Most of the time I try not to think about it. 60-90 ping on most Sydney servers, and I've been playing on SEA servers for months. Ugh. I won't even have NBN until next year. new zealand here. no. 55 on australian servers, 130ish in SEA. All over the place for me, some games are 60-70ms, others are 120-140, had a 300ms game last night too (didn\u2019t stay for long lmao) We have two TV's with Netflix going and being forced to play on SEA resulted in 300-1000 ms Yesterday at 23 I was trying to get solo EU FFP Sanhok working, took multiple minutes to find games with this new patch. Left the game, got no time for this bullshitery.\n\nGonna try again later after work and see how it works.\n\n Autocorrect I swear on my honor as a man of color. Australia has assholes just like everywhere else. As an Aussie I do chuckle at the irony of these posts but hope pubg corp sort this for all. Heh not really, the ones you saw were the exception. Most OCE posts for months were at best ignored and frequently mass downvoted and mocked. Saw plenty of them myself.\n\nObviously it\u2019s \u201cnot everyone\u201d but subs do tend to have their overall opinions and the one on this sub lends heavily to \u201cif it\u2019s not NA/EU then we don\u2019t care, fuck off\u201d. \n\nThat said, I am joking. All players having a good experience is good for everyone! I have no desire for NA/EU/anywhere else to suffer as some form of revenge. Yeah but same token, it\u2019s not like every OCE player is mocking everyone else now is it? Nah man... you might have seen the odd one that picked up steam,  it the vast majority of the time I mentioned it it was downvoted to hell and got a lot of \u201clol nobody cares about oce\u201d comments.\n\nObviously it\u2019s \u201cnot everyone\u201d but end of the day subs *do* have their majority opinion and for OCE that opinion was \u201cyou\u2019re not NA/EU so fuck off we don\u2019t care\u201d. How can you say they haven't fixed the issue?  They have changed the way matchmaking works and we now get to play in OC again.  Sounds like a fix to me.\n More than 3 months mate. Closer to 6 You were told that by assholes, not all of us.  I was there upvoting every post I saw for it, i was demanding the problem get fixed.  You had support, but you only chose to look at the assholes.  And then you chose to be one of them.  Congratulations, you're a piece of shit.  The same piece of shit as all the others that you hate.\n\nYou in particular.  There's still some OCE players that aren't okay with this this, and they're still cool people.  But you are a cunt. I think that makes you the hypocrite.\n\nIf eu and na stop playing this game do you really think bluehole will maintain oce servers for the 19 people that play it down there? If we're gonna be insulting each other -- you need us and we do not need you. I could care less about internet points honestly.  I'm just so disappointed that everyone is against each other when it's not even any of our fault that the game is broken. We shouldn't be angry or spiteful to each other, we should be angry at the root cause of the problem.  The devs are incompetent and can't run their game properly.  They can't put servers where they belong.  They can't un-break an entire region's matchmaking.  They can't test their updates before pushing them live.\n\nBut here we all are, so many people angry at each other as if it's on us that shit is broken as fuck.  This community is just fucked, almost as bad as the devs. I honestly believe it will be going on for a while too.  I honestly am glad that at least it's not a problem that shits on certain people in particular, but the problem is there and it's widespread, and we all should be banding together to make it known that this is intolerable instead of fighting with each other over it.  These devs are just the absolute worst and manage to fuck up so much, I don't even think that any amount of effort from us would make them competent for long enough to fix things.\n\nIt's just frustrating for me to see people who should be angry at the devs instead get angry at each other with excuses such as \"just leave the match and requeue\" or even so ridiculous as \"move to east coast\"\n\nSome people are just the absolute worst. If you play passive, big ping is against you. Thats why using big ping and playing aggressive, enemy wont even see you before you kill them Have you even played pupg? Cause you dont seem to know what your talking about Gold mate !  All of NZ is closer to Sydney than Perth is. I'm in Auckland, with 40ms to most Aussie servers on Steam.  > as a man of color.\n\nDefinitely fake aussie to bring shit like this into it Touch\u00e9 I'd say that's because I'm on EU time because I spend too much time on reddit and I can tell you I used to see 2-3 OCE posts almost every day in the top 5 to 15 posts. So maybe at NA time things changed but that I couldn't witness. I must have blocked out the pain :/ No, that doesn't even make sense. Excactly, agree with everything.\n\nBtw the downvotes just shows how childish the community is. What I meant is that, at least in this case, people didn't downvote you because they disagreed with you, but because all they wanted to say is 'fuck you'.\n\nI don't care about karma too, but I think downvotes/upvotes could be a cool instrument if used properly. I agree mate !  Hell the pings to west coast NA aren't bad from NZ. It was a joke like colour commentary, I couldn't think of other words that are spelt differently :( > spelt \n\nTrue Aussie confirmed after all. I spose it doubled well Aluminium Vs Aluminum. Guys, please, it sounds more like a metal this way. Original name: Alumium\n\nTemporary name: Aluminum\n\nFinal name: Aluminium\n\nEither call it by its original name or by its final name, not by the temporary garbage name (the one the US uses). Alumium sounds good. Growing up, I always thought the US had some other thing called \"Aluminum\", that was different from Aluminium. Since most foreign stuff I watched referenced Aluminium, this just made the confusion worse. Finally got it cleared up in High School, where the chem teacher went on a rant."}], [{"author": "ACUnit13", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/9lh5ep/pubg_irl/", "id": "9lh5ep", "selftext": "", "title": "PUBG irl", "url": "https://i.imgur.com/4RCWnYa.gifv", "gencomments": " Hello - Your post has been removed for violating one of our rules.

I only play Miramar and Sanhok, because of the sparse loot on Erangel. Or it could be my bad luck with the old map. I think an asteroid could hit it and make a crater in middle with some space guns  yea just more stuff on the map in general. Erangel doesn't match the density of stuff that Miramar has. I'd guess Miramar is 2x the stuff, so Erangel might benefit from 0.5 more stuff, so it has 1.5x stuff in total. I agree, we rarely drop in the northwest region.

I'm also noob at the game. Ill try tonight! just a bit more accurate than hip I think, I use that most CQC I'm in. I'm not good though I lean left/right with the side mouse buttons. I cannot use Q and E Whaaaaaat i will bind those tonight. I use a G502 I might need to try this method. I use tilt left/right on my scroll wheel to toggle leaning. Maybe it\u2019s holding me back though. Those are my keybinds as well. I like it so much better. I do it too, it makes it way easier for me. I just can't get my middle finger to accept using Q while ring finger is on A. I use mouse side buttons too. It's such a game changer. Highly recommend  Same mouse :) I do that as well. Hold to lean. And then the new ping feature on Q :P Yeah I wouldn't rely on the scroll wheel left/right. I use it to change the fire mode and I still don't like it that much  I hold, but you can also try toggle. I didn't like toggle  It works pretty well on my G900, but I bet hold works better than toggle. My main problem is that I use my thumb buttons for F (interact) and push to talk.

I don't see the point of this post. is this during NA peak time? By it still being in the top games played?  \"China is clearly keeping PUBG afloat. Look! It's only the third most played game during U.S prime-time on the largest PC gaming platform. DED GAME\"\n\n May be its update time. Please share the full screenshot with time and date. Thanks.  If this is the correct way to analyze this data? I don't know where to start what's wrong with this post.\n\nIt seems like you got wrecked at this game an other time cuz you shit your pants when you hear a gunshot after you had to searched a game for 15 instead of 2 seconds. So you come here and make this ded game post while you should know that it isnt only pretty early in china it is midnight in europe too. But you ignorant american ignored that fact again and wondered why there are only 160k people playing when 3/4 of the world is asleep or at work. [removed] One of the things I liked about BF4 was the campaign game story line had a rebellion in the Chinese military against a repressive government resulting in the game being banned in China.  It would be nice if more games were banned in China, as the rest of the world would have less out-of-region lag and hack use to deal with.  We can only dream. I dont really care. I still have no issues getting games\n\nI just care that my mates and me still love it.\n\nCs go numbers is fine by me and i dont care if the game isnt as big in the US anymore\n\n\n This is why they make updates in US time...not our fault you turned your back on the game.  these posts have no credibility. they never provide context. typically the lowest population occurs at around 7:00 pm EST. this is probably because it's dinner time for most people on the east and central part of the americas. and if you look at the data there's a drop daily before the number peaks at around dinner time for china.\n\n[https://steamcharts.com/app/578080](https://steamcharts.com/app/578080) Pains me to see this. I remember it being well over 2M+ earlier this year. \n\nI guess a large chunk of NA/SA stopped playing and/or went to Blackout, whereas the Chinese population makes up for well over 600K+ of the playerbase? Kinda makes sense, since as we already know, cheating is extremely popular over there. Isn't Steam blocked in China? Oof, that's depressing. You mean how you can tell Call of Duty made a new game with a Battle Royale mode?\n\nEdit- Well, I don't know what else to tell you guys. I made an assumption, I was wrong, I accepted that I was wrong and know I made a mistake. Oh well, I guess. Yeah but the NA market is literally the only one that matters, ever. They\u2019re special snowflakes damnit and unless a game is popular *there*, it\u2019s utter trash!\n\nThis post will do super well on this sub.  Who? If this game wasnt such a buggy hacker filled mess i feel like it would be more popular in the us. It's just another stupid \"game ded\" post It astonishes me how  fucking racist this sub is.\n\nI've seen posts where  people try to  get  Chinese players arrested  through spamming things that are apparently 'censored' through voice chat just because some of  them cheat.\n\nLike, what the fuck? I'm from philippines and i'm used to chinese as teammates, or getting killed by chinese hackers most of the time it pisses me off and complain on the number of cheaters but i never went as far to say or post about banning the whole chinese community in the server. most of these issues came from NA, they think they are special snowflakes and deserves more right to enjoy the game. complain to me about rampant cheating or lagging in your server all you want, but ive been playing in AS/SEA server ever since i bought the game and i got used to them, ain't gonna complain cause its somewhat the game's fault that game can easily be tweaked by chinese hacker whom we know have this cheating culture and server issues. downvote me all you want, but the hate on chinese people is just so disgusting on this sub. all those region lock china or blatant complain about chinese players as their teammates, generalizing that chinese are hackers, having arrested because they think they're hacking, that is just straight up bullying. Around 23% of those players are NA, so about 38,000.  South America makes up a greater percentage of players by a tiny wee bit.\n\nThis game is not very popular in North America.  The game peaks around 65,000 players in the region and it is not during night time according to the information you can find online. Possibly. Also when china goes offline, there is a window between the peak of EU. After that, the peak of US. You\u2019re acting as if being the third most players of any game on Steam without China is a bad thing. 165k is more than H1 ever got, for example. >this is probably because it's dinner time for most people on the east and central part of the americas. \n\nlmao what?  It's because China isn't on.  yep it's been steadily declining in the west for ages. once the playerbase in the west reaches zero, that's precisely when we'll get our region lock, and probably west coast servers too! nope I\u2019d believe cod cuts more into the fortnite demographic Assuming this isn't bait, allow me to give two points as to why this makes very little sense.\n\nA. This is about avg for NA peak times, and is well within a 5% margin of error.\n\nB. Call of Duty (apart from COD Online) isn't available in China, so the primary playerbase of Pubg (AS) is not affected by its release.\n\n http://www.githyp.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-4-has-not-had-any-impact-on-pubgs-player-base-on-steam/ Not sure if you're really stupid, or just trolling.\n\nCall of Duty cannot compare to PUBG in the least, and is for a completely different audience.\n\nIt's an arcade shooter with a BR mode. That's hardly going to affect PUBG, I seriously doubt any BR will be affected by COD, let alone PUBG. should have put /s  More like that is the excuse for poor players. So..... Actually, I like that idea. Chinese ppl love their police-state-country and gov so much, let them have some fun. Trying to fuck with cheaters = racist\n\nSick anology dude\n\n Only asian people are capable of cheating apparently\n It's hard to have a good attitude towards chinese players in pubg when every time I'm in a game with them or somehow get them in my squad, they cheat or team kill or something. True, at the same time it's still number 3 when not during China prime time, regardless of the distribution of the player base at that time, which is why I'd disagree with the idea that only China keeps the game afloat.  Not just without China but without EU as well, since assuming OP took it at the time he posted it, it was around 2AM. So basically the 2 biggest regions for PUBG are asleep and it's still the third most played game on Steam.\n\nI'd say that is pretty solid. Oh. I mean, I thought my statement made sense, it wasn't meant to be \"bait\" or anything like that, nor was I trying to troll. If I'm wrong, I accept that. Sorry if I struck a nerve. But... this sub told me that the game was going to die as soon as it launched, then downvoted me lots for daring to suggest I\u2019d heard the same thing about half a dozen other games that hadn\u2019t panned out...\nI\u2019m so confused! I acknowledged that I was wrong in later comments, but thanks for the link nonetheless. Again, could you read my later comments/replies? I already figured out I was wrong. There was no trolling, and no stupidity. Just making an off assumption does not make me stupid. No point, people act like this here all the time but get *real* pissy at having it pointed out. no we get it's sarcastic. it's downvoted because of the doucheyness of it. Ya ya call me bad. Fuck you. Alright while I don't think it's racist, if I'm understanding the situation right I think it's disproportionately cruel to try and get someone arrested because their countrymen are more likely to use cheats in a game. Literally attempting to steal away a person's freedom because people from that country are more likely to use videogame hacks. Borderline sociopathic tbh. Frankly even if I knew my opponent was using cheats, I wouldn't be trying to get them thrown in jail just to get a fucking kick out of it, let alone having a mild suspicion of cheating. Implying every cheater is asian certainly is Yeah, no shit if you're trying to get a bunch of Chinese players arrested because maybe one or two of them are cheaters, you're a racist POS. It's less that, i'm generally just annoyed at all the people repeating the old \"LOL COD IS GONNA KILL PUBG XDXDXD\" thing while ignoring every semblance of sense that comes with that statement.\n\nI'm not trying to disregard your argument because of what it is, rather, i'm trying to argue against it based on recent evidence. Apologies if it came across the wrong way. That's how NA people think of themselves thou on reddit downvote me too but that's the truth lmao > because of the doucheyness of it.\n\nSure is.. and wouldn't it be nice if it wasn't the attitude of this sub an annoying amount of the time? Yeah Chinese gov literally said 1984 is good and big brother is right. Today, I read a comment about a guy saying ''I left Overwatch and have been stress free, it feels like PTSD whenever I think about playing it again.''\n\nTIL that people let a videogame affect their mental health and consider that to be normal. That illness will take forms such as stress, toxicity, and racist/violent tendencies.\n\nGuys, there's a shut down button. If you prefer to talk about throwing some random dude in jail just because his fellow countrymen cheat in your precious game rather than just closing said game and being free of all that toxicity, well... There's a reason people talk about videogames being an addiction to some folk. [deleted] >maybe one or two of them are cheaters,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLmao, every week the devs upload a PDF of all banned accounts for that week.  It's normally a list of a 200,000 Chinese accounts *every fucking week*. It's fine! Thank you for keeping this civilized. I can see 100% why you'd be annoyed by people making false claims constantly, it'd be annoying for me, aswell. idk where the fuck you are from but you would feel the same if all the maintenance shut downs happened at your local prime time. you could help by not being one of those people! Yeah, I'm  gonna need  a source on that, pal.  Just as unbelievable as the whole  condom pizza shit spread by Miami Cubans. There's no growing up taking an entire ethnicity hostage for a specific group among them.\n\nIt's like blaming all Americans for Trump.\nWe don't. When a game is released by an US-based publisher, guess when server maintenance will be in EU. Correct, primetime. You see us bitching about it? No, so deal with it.  Nope since it's reasonable.  Hahaha I\u2019m Australian. They all fucking do and have my entire life.\n\nOne game does it for you and you want to whine about it? Dude. Call the fuck down, it\u2019s not an American game and the maintenance has to happen sometimes.\n\nShockingly it\u2019s gonna happen when the devs are awake.  Really missing the point today aren't you?  https://www.guancha.cn/JeremyChoo/2018_07_12_463742_6.shtml\n\nps: Guancha.cn is a Chinese-gov controlled propaganda website. give me ONE example from a well populated game! ONE game that does what pubg does but to europe! the only point you're making is you blame the douches, yet you're one! I can't find any source of them being controlled directly by the PRC, and  it's literally the opinion of one single person. Just because I can find an American arguing that  flat earth theory is  real, doesn't mean every US citizen believes  that. H1 used to do it back in the day when they was poppin. Is Donald Trump a game? H1 never got maintenance shut downs at peak europe times. what are you talking about?!  Yeah they did.  dude stfu. you can't even think a single game. I gave you a game and you are just in denial :)"}], [{"author": "Sinc_Y", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/9ot6d9/feedback_pls_pro_player/", "id": "9ot6d9", "selftext": "Hey guys, I started recording and streaming gameplay videos.
